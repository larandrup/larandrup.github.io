Coffee,Green_Gal27,ktbqf2,Tips for creating faux-espresso/expresso-like coffee at home,"Hi all,

So up front, I can't afford an espresso machine, nor do I think, at this point in my life, that it'd be a good buy. My husband isn't a huge fan of coffee and truthfully I'm not sure if I have the patience and time to spend on creating espresso at home. I toyed with a Nespresso for a while, but I just can't get behind the disposable pods even though they're recyclable (or Néstle).

But that said, I'm really missing espresso-based drinks (latté, cappuccino, flat white) and would love to make something similar at home. Doesn't have to be true espresso, but anything that can get me close to that.

I've tried the Moka pot and french press milk frother route, but it's been difficult. I have a crap Moka pot I bought at a garage sale for $5, and doing the milk frother in the french press always makes a mess and the whole thing takes forever.

I'm leaning towards a new Moka pot and buying a milk frother. Any thoughts on that, or other avenues? Any tips for making Moka pot coffee actually taste good? I'd say our budget is around $150 CAD (but could go higher if cost/benefit is there).

Thanks!

Coffee,anabolicslav,kt8tov,Need help with sage barista express (newbie),"Hello everyone  


I recently bought sage barista express, so for first two weeks I was using supermarket beans, illy and starbucks and some random brand. It was very easy to dial in with them, i sticked to 3-5 grind setting and usually had to increase the dose and give a good tamp, my pressure was pretty much always in ""Perfect range"" and timing was good, also the yield and taste was perfect.  


After 2 weeks of doing good coffee with supermarket beans i decided to buy some ""Premium beans"" that are freshly roasted, bought some medium-dark roast and now have absolute nightmare trying to dial.  


At low grind setting 3-5, and normal 18g dose and good tamp, pressure would skyrocket and extraction would be really slow and coffe ends up thick.  


With higher grind setting 8-10, if i use same dose of 18g and give a good tamp, it's  the same. If i decrease the dose and dont tamp as hard the pressure goes to higher end of ""espresso range"" and extraction is very fast, also the auto mode no longer gives 30-40g, the yield has increased to like 100-150g lol, i never reprogrammed it? Also i tried resetting to default settings and it's the same, the yield is super high.

Coffee,SirCabbage420,kt8i6x,I do not drink any sort of caffeine but even 10mg of caffeine makes me feel more hyper. 30mg leads me to feel overwhelming hyper and a cup of coffee makes me so hyper that I cant focus on anything and potentially leads to a panic attack. But I've been reading how other people barely feel any effects,"I'm not sure if its a placebo or it varies person to person or what. I have loved coffee all my life and have never been ""addicted"" to it but have had periods where I've indulged daily. I could easily stop  drinking it and go back to it all throughout high school with no problem. Then I had my first panic attack on caffeine and haven't been the same since. After that, i would ""feel"" the effects of the coffee when it used to just be unnoticeable. Even if i drank a cup of cold brew at 4pm, i would sleep fine and feel totally normal.

&amp;#x200B;

But ever since that day, I've had caffeine effect me more and more intensely every time i try to go back to it. As in, ill try some for a few days, the stress and mental effects will be too much then ill stop. This occurred for about a year until i had another panic attack after trying a cup of coffee. This one ended my caffeine intake altogether and i am currently in the works of fixing the anxiety but it is still there. I don't know if the anxiety is the reason im feeling the caffeine so much.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, i only have dark chocolate as a source of caffeine and i can ""feel"" the effects of that with even one square of it. 3 squares feel like a cup of coffee. I really want to get back into drinking coffee but am afraid i will just experience the same cycle again. I don't know why i feel caffeine so much when I've read articles like this [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/i-drank-5-cups-of-coffee-after-a-huge-break-2016-8#my-takeaway-6) where she says she doesn't even feel the effects of caffeine after 3 months of 0 intake. How is it even possible that caffeine feels like meth to me? I just miss the days where i could drink it and not feel this overwhelming mental effect and then crash hard 4 hours later.

The answer is yes, and it's fantastic. I wanted to share my adaptation :


Beans: Crimson Cup Wayfarer
Grind: 20 on Virtuoso
Water: Kroger spring water


47g beans
750ml (6 cup mark) water


1. Make a little well in the grounds with your fingers

2. Start the moccamaster

3. Once all the grounds are wet, swirl the basket until it looks nice and even

4. When about half the water is gone, swirl again

5. When all the water is gone from the reservoir, stir 1.5 times clockwise and once counterclockwise with a spoon (get to the bottom), wait 5 or 10 seconds, and swirl one last time

6. When the water starts to drip into the carafe, close the valve on the reservoir to stop the flow and enjoy

Having read the brief guide on here that mentioned the Hario Skerton grinders and the online hype over thr Timemore C2 I thought they would be a good starting point. I did look at amazon reviews for similarly priced electric grinders which were positive but I get the impression at my budget a manual grinder would produce better results. We only drink 1 cup each a day so don't need to bulk grind. 

The Hario is a bit cheaper and I think I prefer the glass aesthetic however I hoped some of you may have experience of both. 

The main coffee style would be pour over using a bodum pour over Maker but we also have a duo temp Pro which I use. 

Are either of them capable of pour over and espresso grinds? The main factor would be coarser as it is a gift for someone that uses a pour over maker most of the time but if either would be suitable for dual use that would be ideal.

Coffee,jxdlam,kszyb1,Troubleshooting a bitter cold brew,"Hi all, I just started diving into cold brew and would like to seek help for those who are using [Hario Filter-in Coffee bottle](https://global.hario.com/pickup_fic_m.html) along with the given recipe. 

TL:DR - 50g beans, 750g water (inclusive of filter and grounds weight), 18 hours - turned out bitter. (question below)

Beans used: Brazil Cerrado, medium-dark, 50g (roasted 2 days ago)

Grinder: Timemore C2, 24 clicks

Water: Filter water, room temperature

Process: Grinded beans fresh and put all into filter. Poured water in through the filter with a bit of time in between to let the beans soak through. I didn't measure the amount of water but the water level reached the approx 750ml mark (inclusive of the weight from grounds and filter)

At the 10th hour mark, I took a small sip (by opening the cap and not pouring through the grounds) and found the taste to be weird (there was a weird aftertaste that i couldn't describe as bitter so decided to deem it acidic - it didn't taste chocolately at all). I put in back into the fridge thinking it might be underextracted.

At the 12th hour mark, I took another sip (similiar method) and still had the same issue with the taste.

Had to go out for appointment and when i got back at around the 18th hour mark, I took out the filter, gave the bottle a good shake and drank a mouthful. Taste was woody with aftertaste, but still no chocolately flavor.

Question: I would like to fix it but unsure where to start.

Thinking if i should adjust the following while keeping everything else the same and test at 8, 12 and 16th hour (stopping at whichever is flavourful or woody)

1) Increase the grind to medium-coarse (20 clicks?) 

2) Add 5g of grounds but stick to the same grind

Any other suggestions or analysis is greatly welcome.

Coffee,Playful_Ad7130,ksujn9,Why does my upgraded grinder make WORSE coffee?,"I just upgraded from a cheap blade grinder to a nice burr grinder, and I really like it! However, it's so much finickier than my old blade grinder, and I'm just wondering if anybody knows why that is the case. I like French press coffee, medium to medium dark roast, and with the old grinder basically anything I made was delicious; I never measured the coffee and always eyeballed it, but it was so forgiving that I don't think I ever had a bad cup. With the burr grinder, it's a toss-up whether it'll be too weak or too strong. 

Also, in that vein, my all-time fav coffee seems to just taste better with a blade grinder! It doesn't make sense to me that a better grind (and I can see, visibly, that the grind is more uniform with fewer big chunks and shards) results in worse coffee. I'm picking up a lot of bitterness when I use the burr grinder, when the blade grinder for this specific coffee bean has always given me a smooth, chocolatey, very sweet cup. I haven't noticed this with other coffees. Can anybody tell me why that is?",1610078146

Also, yes, I've looked into my local coffee shops, and I've been getting beans from a local for over a year. The convenience of having things shipped to my door is definitely appealing to me, vs. having to drive 15 minutes each way to pick it up (they don't deliver yet).

[The ones on the right](https://christopherbean.com/winter-wonderland/) are from a ""specialty"" coffee site where they don't even roast the beans until you order, and they did take a while to even ship so I believe that much. They list the roast temperature (425 F for those), the region (South America, but they didn't list the country?), the altitude they were grown, etc. so I thought ""hey they must be legit"" but idk if maybe it's just because of my lack of coffee knowledge.  
[The ones on the left](https://store.coffeebean.com/products/peru-organic-coffee) are from a brand that sells on Amazon but also have their own site (I bought them off Amazon), so I have no idea when the beans were roasted, but they said they were grown in Peru and that's pretty much the only information they provide.   
The left beans had more flavor and complexity than the right ones despite them both being ground and brewed the same way and with the same quality of water and everything else. Is this normal?

my coffee doesn’t taste great. it kind of just tastes like water... like i really can’t taste much. so at first i thought it was the type of coffee i was using, so i bought really nice expensive fresh beans and had the same problem. what am i doing wrong?

looking for advice on how much coffee you put in with water. i don’t have a scale so would prefer if you could tell me tablespoons/cups of water or something. i keep trying to google it and it just says 4oz and 12g and stuff like that that i’m not sure about. also, are whole coffee beans in a tablespoon the same as ground? 

what i do is i measure out 4 tablespoons of whole beans into my grinder, then grind it then pour all of it into the coffee machine. 

my beans are dark roast, and i’m grinding them to medium/fine i think. don’t know if i’m doing that wrong either.

Coffee,applysauce,ksjs88,OXO Brew 8-cup experience (for smaller batches),"I recently got this brewer. I think it makes good tasting coffee without fuss, but it doesn't seem to work as well for brewing smaller amounts of coffee. My understanding and experience is that drip brewers tend to do better when brewing more coffee (without adjusting the coffee:water ratio). Since this brewer includes a small batch insert, I thought it might perform just as well when brewing less coffee.

The coffee maker works well when using the 4-8 cup setting, brewing at least 40 grams of coffee (in a typical 1:16 or 17 ratio). I've used the smaller single-serve insert plus the smaller filters to try brewing a smaller amount of coffee (25-35 g), but these tend to taste more watery. I've used up the included filters and have begun using the pricey Kalita wave filters (which seem similar to the included filters). (Note, for brewing 4-8 cups, walmart paper basket filters do just fine.) My grind is appropriate since I'm using pre-ground coffee for these experiments, which is way more uniform that what my current grinder can produce.

Any experience brewing a smaller amount of coffee? Is it necessary to use more coffee for a given amount of water?",1610045421

Coffee,klausa,ksir35,Superautomatic machine for an office of ~30-50 people!,"Heyo!

My company is moving offices and that means we need to get our own coffee machine, which I’ve been pulled in to help out with picking.

I originaly wanted to get the Breville/Sage Oracle Touch, but I’ve been (ultimately, I think correctly) vetoed, saying that nobody is going to learn how to use portafilters and clean them properly.

So, into the realm of superautomatics we go. The problem is I know literally nothing about those — and am asking you for help :)

We’re probably looking at like \~60-ish drinks a day? It needs to be easy to use, and relatively easy to clean and maintain. It’d be perfect if it could steam milk and do cappuccinos/etc automagically to.

Sourcing good beans isn’t a problem, since we’re located in Berlin :)

We’re looking at probably \~2000 Euro budget here? I could maybe expand that a little bit, but not wildly so.

Or is the entire enterprise at this price range pointless, and I should let someone else pick a „meh” machine, and advocate for a separate, nice pourover setup for those who want to spend more than 30s brewing their coffee?

Coffee,mastley3,kshz88,"Too much caffeine, or not enough?","
I am not good at sleeping any more. I'm in my mid-40s. Used to sleep like a baby, but now, almost every night, I fall asleep quickly, but struggle to stay asleep through the night. I often have several hours where I am restless, and occasionally cannot sleep at all after, say 4 am.

As I result, I had been drinking a bit less coffee. I generally do pourovers at 18g, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon. I had been cutting back on the amount in my afternoon cup, hoping that in doing so, I would lessen the amount of caffeine in my system, and therefore get through the night more easily. Ive gotten down to 13g, but the impact on my sleep has not been significant.

Recently, I heard (maybe not for the first time) that the good feeling of drinking coffee in the morning is not from the stimulation of caffeine, but from relief from caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I have heard for years that caffeine doesn't actually ""wake you up"" but that it blocks a receptor for the hormone that makes us sleepy, so this makes a bit of sense.

So my experiment for today is to go back to drinking more in the afternoon. Maybe I can hit an amount where my withdrawal hits at 7, when I'm supposed to wake up???

Does anyone have experience with this? Am I crazy (its the sleep deprivation!)?",1610040365

I have since purchased an Aeropress but generally stuck to preground coffee until now, when I got a Timemore C2. It was delivered today. My beans came yesterday.

As I understand it, the 0 point for measuring grind settings is where the dial stops while turning it towards 'fine'. I did some research and decided to set the grind to 20 for my aeropress. While the cup I brewed was heavenly, and I definitely understand why one should go for freshly ground over pre ground, the grind seemed a little coarser than the preground stuff I am used to. (All the coffee vendors here let you pick the grind type when you order, and they are classified 'French press', 'aeropress' etc instead of numbers. You pick the grind type according to the equipment you have.)

Am I doing this right? Is the 0 point really how I described it? Is the grind setting I've used today actually optimal for Aeropress? If I'm understanding this correctly, the finest setting should be 0.",1610039699

But I decided, why not, so I took it apart (baratza virtuoso+) and didn't do anything drastic, just used the included cleaning brush and wiped out the burrs, etc. Well, I solved the mystery of why my grind size has slowly been getting 'bigger.' Over time, I've noticed that I have been slowly moving the indicator to the right and was slightly perplexed why I've been having to do this when I recall getting good coffee at a 'smaller' grind without overextracting. Well, it seems that it was slowly clogging and causing the grind size to get smaller all on its own and I was just covering up the symptom. My first cup after grinding had much larger particles which I didn't notice til I was done brewing and looking at the coffee bed. It also brewed much faster so I ended up with a fairly under extracted cup, *but* I feel I learned something and helped make past experiences make more sense.

Coffee,edamlambert,kudw9z,Tasting coffee is harder than I thought.,"I've been trying to get into coffee past few months and got my first grinder like month or two ago. I realized that to get most out of it, I have to be able to adjust it right. And to do that I have to be able to taste what is wrong in the cup in the first place.

Today I did a small test or tasting. I brewed two small cups of filter coffee, one with coarsest grind I got out from my grinder and another one with the finest grind. My goal was to find out how over extracted coffee tastes like and vice versa how under extracted coffee tastes like.

Once I got all set up and started slurping, at first I couldn't tell what the difference between the two cups was. They pretty clearly tasted different, but I couldn't tell myself what the difference was. As the cups cooled down tasting got easier.

Still pretty much all I learned from this was what the ""bitter"" meanswhen talking about over extracted coffee. I couldn't 
distinguish any clear tastes from the under extracted version. Again I tasted something, but I didnt't find any words for it. Maybe it was too coarse so there really wasn't much to taste.

I think I'll try this again some day, but go less extreme with the grind settings. Maybe it would be easier to taste then.

I have no guestions or anything here, I just wanted to share this small adventure about my first steps in the world of coffee and maybe provoke some conversation. Thanks for reading through!",1610282890

I am not as active as I used to, but I feel like this subreddit has become overly elitist in the way it is managed. Most content is deleted based on rules that are hidden :

* Rules are supposed to be in the right panel, and links to https://www.reddit.com//r/Coffee/wiki/rules

For Christmas I bought our family a Breville Barista express and I am having a little trouble dialing in my shots. For the first bag I bought from a local roaster and the espresso was really good. In my opinion it had nice balance and good pressure and timing. For my next bag of beans is when I started having some issues. I bought a bag of Partners flatiron coffee from Whole Foods and it was roughly a week after the roast date. The coffee tasted terrible, it was either bitter or sour and the only way I could drink it was with plenty of milk. I then bought two bags of stumptown. One was the Holler Mountain and the other was their Hairbender. Again both of these had very either bitter or sour results and I couldn‚Äôt taste any of the flavors that were described on their bag. 

I am doing roughly 17/18 gram doses and grinding on the finest setting on my Breville. I have a distributor and a tamper that‚Äôs set to 30lbs of pressure. The pressure gauge is in the correct zone around 12 o‚Äôclock. I am also unsure of when to start timing myself but from the first drips to a 1:2 ratio takes about 28 ish seconds. I still can‚Äôt get anything drinkable without putting a bunch of milk in it. I am not sure what I am doing wrong when my first experience was relatively pleasant. I appreciate any tips you guys would be able to give me. Thanks!",1610231854

I use a Comandante grinder, currently at 25 clicks and an Aeropress. The recipe is 14g of coffee to 200g of water (93 Degrees), Tim Wendelboe's Recipe. (Stir, sit 1 minute, stir again, press). The water is bottled and has a pretty low TDS count (can't tell exactly right now). 

Now when the coffee is cooled down quite a bit i can easily get the honeydew melon.

Coffee,arktal,ktz4q8,Extremely bitter yet fast espresso shot,"Hello,

I received a PID for my Gaggia Classic and tried my first shot with it. While it was the cleanest shot I've ever made (no coffee spilled everywhere through the naked PF), but I got ~2x yield (18 in, 38 out) in 20 seconds and it tasted bitter as hell.

From my understanding of the [espresso compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-espresso-compass/) it means that I'm over-extracting and should decrease yield. But if I do that, my time variable will move as well and I will end up with a 15 seconds shots, so I am a bit lost.

What variable should I change to try to improve my espresso?

Setup :

* Gaggia Classic 2012 with PID + Pre-infusion (1.5s pre-infusion + 2.5s delay before actually pulling the shot)
* Niche Zero on 10
* VST 18g basket + Naked PF

So I would much rather have iced coffee and I do drink it often ( I buy the Starbucks iced coffee blonde roast and it's perfect ), but sometimes I enjoy a hot cup. So I have fresh flavored light roast coffee, and I measured out two tablespoons of grounds, added 6 oz of water ( I had a small mug and it fit fine ).

I added creamer, and it's just...not good. It's almost salty. 

So I guess I'm just looking for answers I'm sure you pros already know lol. Do I add more water next time? Do I try to brew it on the regular setting and not bold?

Coffee,WestoT,ktqyaj,Women in leadership in the coffee industry.,"Hi I'm writing a little thing for uni about ethics in the coffee industry - I was wondering if anyone has any data/experiences about the role of women. I've not looked into it yet, but my general impression is that it seems to be very male dominated throughout the supply chain, like I see that women work on farms - but these all seem to be run by men. (I seem to remember hearing about a women run collective in Ethiopia, but that's the only example I can think of off the top of my head). Then, even when I look at a random sample of the businesses I use, or that they say they use, there's just more men, especially at the top.
 I know the issue of the lack of women in top positions is way bigger than the coffee industry, and likely not as bad amongst this industry as others, but I'd love to know more about it - if anyone has any stories of feeling like there were barriers to entry or a glass ceiling, or better yet success stories please share them.",1610199095
Coffee,ycpl,ktqjvv,How do I get this light roast working using a V60? Flavour is weak.,"I've got a light to medium roast specialty coffee. No matter how I brew it, it keeps tasting like very weak tea. The taste is nowhere near the strawberry/milk chocolate hints it should have. I brew using a V60. I've tried multiple method of brewing, as well as the high extraction Rao method with water just of the boil and a ratio of 1:15, to obtain an high extraction. Draw down time is around 3 minutes. What's probably not helping as well is the fact I use grind setting 3-7-2 on my JX-Pro. Any finer will result in too many fines with this particular beans, worsening flow and creating a weak flavor as well.

Any tips on how to get this light roast working? Thanks!",1610197331

Coffee,registrationmail,ktoew2,Strange experience with Starbucks blonde espresso roast,"Hi people.   


I'm usually into freshly roasted coffee but we had guests who like really classic grocery store type of coffee so I went and bought some starbucks blonde espresso roast, not expecting much.   
Such a weird experience with this one.   
It brews pretty good in a Moka Pot and decently in a Aeropress. Really balanced, like really realy - it looks like it is pretty hard ot mess it up. Also pretty flat as a taste - good but super flat and without anything going on (which is also not that bad).   
What surprised me the most tho is that the one I got was relatively old - it was brewed a few months ago, but it kept its taste for thru the 2 weeks i've been drinking it.   
So yeah - pretty weird coffee - classic taste, super flat, but somehow durable (for lack of a better word).

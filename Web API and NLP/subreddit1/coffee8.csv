Coffee,PartyAtTheMoon-Tower,llf4cq,Using third wave water? Having trouble getting good cups? Halve your mineral dose.,"So I've been struggling with my coffee for quite some time. Some of you may even recognize me from previous posts where I seek help, and am completely baffled why I couldn't achieve the same results as many of you. I have top of the line equipment, years of experience with honing my pour technique, etc. Simply put: I'm no expert, but I should be getting SOME kind of results.

Well, recently I caught wind of a few convos across reddit regarding third wave water. It's something I've used for several years, and have never really given it much thought. After all, all I hear is how optimized it is, and if there are problems with my cups, it's likely my technique, the beans, etc.

Basically, some people mentioned that they felt Third Wave Water creates a water profile that is pretty hard (I want to say 150ppm?). They felt the mineral supplement created harsh, chalky or flat cups. ""Hey! That sounds like my cups."" I thought. I've been having cups with a borderline umami profile for a while now. No aroma. Not much at all really. Occasionally I'd luck out and hit the sweet spot at coarser grinds, but not often.

I own a REMI grinder, and couldn't figure out why the grind reccs felt too fine for me. They created such sludgy cups. Coarse tasted better, but also felt weak. Well, per some recommendations I halved my third wave water dose.

WOW. What an incredible difference.

I waited to post this until I made sure I wasn't crazy. Across 6 coffees, different regions and roasters, my cups have been beautiful. Floral, aromatic, bright, sweet, etc. I can taste all of the flavors on the bag, and more than that. All because my water isn't as hard. I'm getting the benefit of third wave water without the full strength of it. This perfectly explains why I always looked back several years ago, and wondered why I had better cups then? Well, my water probably wasn't as hard!

Anyway, I figure someone reading this might be struggling too. If you are used Third Wave Water, consider halving your dose. Two gallons for 1 packet. That may be the fix you need. Plus, it's cheaper in the long run!",1613513728
Coffee,loodog555,llen1f,I just read through all the physics papers about Moka posts I could get my hands on and here's what I found:,"Basically, there are 4 physics papers that address how Moka pots work:

A 2002 paper (in Italian!) by Varlamov and Balestrino, which a later paper (2009 Navarini) calls wrong.

A 2006 paper by Gianino (who I corresponded with to create this video, which has it origins in a high school project)

A 2008 paper by King (who I also corresponded with)

2009 paper by Navarini et. al (who has not replied).

The big take-home message is that the pressure the air contributes significantly changes the dynamics of how the thing works compared to vapor pressure of the water alone. The big surprise is that it lowers the pressure and so delays the brewing, which is a good thing, because otherwise your coffee brews at too low a temperature to extract properly.

Main points:

1. a moka pot does *not* in general brew by boiling water

2. preheated water &gt; cold water because the coffee will extract at too low a temperature if you don't preheat

3. how much you fill up the pot affects the brewing as well, with more initial water causing a delay in brewing until pot reaches higher temperature, which is why you should always fill up to the fill valve.

Any questions about this, you can post here and I will reply, but I also made a [video on my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl4K1no9gh8) which summarizes in pictures and stuff. 

I hope I'm following sub rules this time around.  Sorry if not!",1613512355

Coffee,juliusklaas,lld3dp,Does the perfect espresso machine exist?,"First of all, I get the artisan process of making a good espresso (only coffee I really care about). But I only care bout the end product. I’m thinking about getting something like an Eureka Mignon Silenzio mill (500) and a Rocket Chronometre R Mozzafiato (2300) plumbed into filtered main water supply and drain. This would give me a lot of flexibility, and if you see it as a hobby, one could probably make world class espresso with this setup without a lot of hassle, given you have good coffee.

My parents have a full auto machine at home (some medium level Jura). The espresso is not great. I’ve had good coffee from fully automated machines, but never as good as the best handmade. As someone with a mechanical engineering background, I refuse the idea that one cannot build a full-auto machine that makes the perfect espresso.

Coffee,leafunderneath,ll3pnx,Does coffee [caffeine] negatively or positively affect those with ADHD? Is mixing coffee with Adderall/ADHD medication a bad idea? Could it increase tolerance faster?,"I have ADHD, and at first when I started drinking coffee, a couple years ago, it would make me feel sleepy tbh. I thought it was so weird because everyone expressed how “wired” they would feel after a cup of Joe, and the stereotype of it waking you up, just wasn’t what I was experiencing. But then learned from my doctor that it may have a calming affect on those with ADHD because of the stimulant calming the hyperactivity. 

But I’m curious if coffee is a bad mix with Adderall/ADHD medication? Like should I wait a few hours after coffee to take my Adderall? Or are they not nearly close enough in equivalence to caffeine/being a stimulant?

Coffee,SomeoneLeo,ll2pmy,Aeropress smells and tastes like burned rubber,"Hey, I have my AeroPress for a couple of years now, but during the past weeks it developed an issue, where the coffee I brew with it smells and tastes like burned rubber. Not a bit, like, really, really disgusting and undrinkable. I did not move to a new place and I did not change my recipe. I also tasted the water cold and hot before tasting it, it tasted good. Also the water from rinsing the paper - no bad taste there either. The weird thing is, that this doesn't always happen. I put the plunger into the dishwasher now since I suspect the rubber to be the issue and the first coffee I made with it tasted perfectly fine (I rinsed the parts afterwards with hot water), but the coffee on the next day smelled and tasted absolutely disgusting again. Next time I washed the rubber with hot water and soap before using it, but I still got an undrinkable cup.

Did any of you ever encounter that issue or has heard of something like that happening?

Coffee,creamyhorror,lkzfpc,"Taste of coffee degrades noticeably if left exposed to air, in just 30 min?","I've noticed that when I reduce my brewed coffee's exposure to fresh air, it stays tasty for much longer. I put an airtight silicone lid on my cup that stops almost all air exchange with the outside.

If I leave it uncovered, in just 30 minutes, it turns noticeably more bitter (and sour) and loses a lot of complex and tasty flavours. After an hour or two it tastes outright unpleasant (horribly bitter). The effect is slowed if the volume of coffee is large, e.g. a batch in a carafe, presumably since there's less surface area exposed to air.

I noticed this over the weekend when an uncle visited and I made coffee for us. I covered my cup while he left his uncovered for 30 min while having dinner, and mine was still tasty while he remarked that his tasted a lot worse after dinner.

Anyone else notice this and always cover their coffee? Or am I imagining it?

Here is what I'm using:

* Coffee - Philz Philtered Soul (medium, slightly oily roast)
* OXO Conical Burr Grinder
* Chemex &amp; Chemex filters
* Gooseneck Kettle (no temp control)

Here is my base method:

1. Filter tap water through Brita &amp; bring to boil in kettle
2. Grind 20g of coffee to medium coarseness (8 on scale of 1-15)
3. Wet Chemex filter with hot tap water &amp; put grounds in
4. Wait 30 seconds post-boil for water to cool
5. Bloom grounds with 45g water for 30 seconds, agitate any dry sports
6. Pour the total of 340g water (17:1 ratio) in slowly and in circular motion
7. Swirl around every two minutes until done

Thinking I could dial it in with just grind size, I've tried going down to a 7 and even slightly below that with micro-settings. I've also tried only waiting 15 seconds off the boil, blooming for 40 seconds, and going down to a 16:1 ratio but it just isn't turning out quite right.

Coffee,ghantazbells,lkk9le,Finally figured out the Moka Pot,"I don’t know if this is common knowledge but the common Moka pot technique of filling the the basket all the way and filling hot/boiling water up to the valve do NOT yield the best results. I never managed to make a great cup by doing so. I mean they were really good but never great. I read somewhere that the coffee:water ratio should be 1:11. For my pot, the coffee amount was almost the absolute limit of the basket (about 14 grams in my 3-cup pot). On a whim I measured the amount of water that was always left behind in the boiler after a brew, subtracted that from the total amount I put in (up to the valve) and THEN calculated the amount of coffee required. Turns out it should be around 11 grams (at level 10 on my encore) and the difference in taste is night and day. To all of you still struggling with your moka pot, just try calculating your coffee amounts in this way. Just remember to stop the brew the moment it even feels like the pot is about to sputter.

Coffee,Mottotta,lkk1si,UK based and looking to take my first steps into home espresso,"I’m looking to buy my first espresso machine for my home, will be used for a mixture of espresso and milk drinks, but probably only light use - maybe one or two uses a day max. Current grinder is a wilfa uniform (though will likely upgrade to a niche zero eventually). 

I’m looking to spend around £500 and have considered the following so far

Lelit grace - PID and pressure gauge, looks like it would be able to manage my light workload but drawback is the 57mm portafilter 

Lelit Victoria - as above but has a 58mm portafilter unfortunately probably stretching out of budget and very hard to source reliably in the UK. 

Rancilio Silvia - would want to add a PID which looks fairly time intensive and I’m also fairly clumsy 

La Pavoni casabar PID - has a PID and a pressure gauge but probably at the top of the price I’d want to pay. 

I’m not massively keen on buying secondhand and I think the dream machine would be a DE1 but I’m way out of that price range haha. 

Any other machines I should be considering? What do you all think of the machines above? Personally I’m putting the lelit grace at the front just now but would be willing to be swayed!",1613414668

This is my first time visiting the subreddit, and I’d like to start by saying hello to the coffee fanatics of reddit. I want to start getting into drinking high quality coffee, but I have a bit of an issue. I like the effects of caffeine, but I find I am moderately more sensitive than others to caffeine. I do not want to drink decaf coffee, as I do like the effects of caffeine. But I was looking for someone to suggest a whole bean coffee that is naturally lower in caffeine so I can still get the pleasant effects of caffeine but without getting the unpleasant effects of being overly caffeinated. I typically use a pour over for brewing if that helps. I noticed that I had a bad reaction to a Tanzanian coffee I drank from my local coffee shop the other day, but then when they started using a Brazilian bean it was much more pleasant.

as our Delonghi ESAM5700 gave up, we spent the previous months trying to find a proper replacement. We tried the Delonghi ECAM35075SI - three times. It is a great machine, if it works. After three machines had issues after few weeks (always another one), we gave it back and tried the Philips 3200 LatteGo, but the milk frother solution is not well thought through in our opinion. So this one went back as well.

As my wife has been drinking less Latte Macciattos recently, the idea is now to go back to a more traditional coffee machine. Unfortunately, a lot of machines recommended here seem to be Espresso machines. We would need one of the machines above, but without the milk solution, so grinder etc included and the option to get the milk steames manually.

Can you guys recommend something well-built and long-lasting?

Coffee,angelo_mateo,lkg9o2,Baratza Encore M2 Burr Upgrade Tip - Washer Installation,"Hey everyone!

I spent this Valentine's Day and this following morning installing the M2 burrs (from the Virtuoso and Precision) into my Encore - as some of you have done on here.

I actually had a lot of trouble installing it. There are some good videos out there showing the process, but I felt something was wrong on the first grind. Grinding at the same setting (11) from before the upgrade produced much coarser grinds. The brew tasted off, but I thought the burrs just needed to be broken in.

I tried making a cup this morning and I just got frustrated that I spent money and time trying to ""upgrade"" my Encore, and I was getting worse cups. So I Googled it and, as I suspected, I reinstalled the washers wrong. There are these little metal rings, 6 of them in total in 3 different sizes. And it turns out, you have to put them in the right order or else the grind will be off! I reinstalled it earlier this morning and it turned out better, but then I realized, I got the order wrong again! So I reinstalled it again! All in all, I spent about 2 hours yesterday learning how to take it apart and reinstall it again and then all of the cleanup, and then about 30 min for each reinstall attempt this morning (I remembered much of the steps from last night).

Was the upgrade worth it? Honestly, I don't know. Now that everything is fixed and the grind seems right, it produced a great cup! But not drastically different, but I'll have to check back in in a few weeks when I've had time to try the burrs more. The consistency of the grind by eye was much better with less fines. One surprising benefit I noticed: less channeling! 

But the whole process of taking it apart, installing it, and putting it back together was much more difficult than I thought and I didn't expect that these little thin rings would screw up everything. If I didn't have spare time and the patience to tinker with it, I would definitely be frustrated and say it wasn't worth it. But I love my coffee and I'm happy taking time to care, especially if my cups taste better from here on out!

[If you're going to upgrade your burrs, please use this PDF from Baratza to figure out the washer situation!](https://www.baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Washer-Guide-Conical-Grinders-1.pdf) It'll save you from a lot of frustration.

[Cabeen's Coffee Corner's video guide is your best friend in helping you through this process.](https://youtu.be/vxbaS8UXCpk)

There are a few other videos on YouTube that will help. [Baratza's video on installing the GB 2.0 Kit on the Preciso can also help, just because the inner parts are roughly the same as the Encore](https://youtu.be/RCa_wReQl9A) (but don't rely on this video as much because it isn't the exact same as the Encore).

Coffee,czar_el,lkg0rb,Immersion w/ Paper Filter,"I've been a longtime french press lover, who went back to pour over in the last few years due in part to wanting to test all the new techniques and in part due to recent science about coffee oils being unhealthy (quick primer: they are associated with elevated cholesterol according to a recent meta-analysis, but can be removed w/ paper filter methods). Also, understanding the physics of brew extraction (and comments from experts like Hoffman), it makes total sense that immersion is better for even &amp; complete extraction. 

That leads me to immersion methods with a paper filter component as a great compromise between the points above. I know the Clever brewer is popular for that reason, but I don't like plastic vessels for dealing with hot water (yes, they're BPA-free, but there  are so many understudied components in plastics, it's only a matter of time IMO before the next as-yet-undiscovered BPA-like human health impact is identified). So, I decided to replicate Clever directly in my mug.

I experimented with just lining my mug with a pre-washed paper filter, making sure my coffee-water ratio was right for that particular mug size, and manually pulling the filter and grounds out when brewing was done (letting the remaining water in the grounds drain for 30 secs over the mug). ***It was delicious!*** And cleanup really wasn't hard at all, nor did I burn my fingers as I was afraid I might.

I'm working with a new medium roast washed coffee from El Salvador and a Hario Skerton Plus grinder and I've just got it dialed in to my taste this morning with the Hoffmann method. (It's a real nice coffee and tastes just like white chocolate!) I'm curious to try 4:6 with the same coffee this afternoon, but I have my reservations. For this particular coffee, I tend to grind pretty damn fine à la Hoff's recommendation (2 notches from zero on the Skerton if that means anything), and even then, the drawdown for this coffee is super quick, usually ending just shy of three minutes at that grind setting. Now Kasuya-san advocates grinding at around a French Press type grind, which just seems mind-blowing to me, but I hear so many good things about the 4:6 method producing an almost foolproof cup of coffee, so I'm really interested to try it out. Maybe I'm just working with a weird coffee, but in general ,what's your experiences been, and which method do you *generally* prefer?

Coffee,ImUntilted,lkawu7,"Getting ""a cup less than supposed to"" with a moka pot","I've started brewing with a 3-cup moka pot recently. The last two times I've brewed I thought it was slightly less liquid than usual. It turned out to be only approximately two cups instead of the three I usually get. I'd been changing some things with the brew going along but I can't explain this. Of course the liquid is still in the brewer in the bottom chamber but I always remove the moka when the foamy and more translucent liquid starts oozing out. That stuff's all bitter so I prefer not having it in my cup.

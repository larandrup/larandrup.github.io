Coffee,1kingofmycastle,l9mzjn,Espresso and drip grinder - from Baratza Preciso to Sette 270. Good Idea? Should I still keep my Preciso for Drip?,"For 6 years now I have been using my Preciso for Drip only. I recently started brewing espresso and now I am wondering about these questions while having a Baratza Preciso grinder:

1. Does anyone have experience about the difference between the Preciso and the Sette 270? Is the taste much better?
2. I still enjoy having drip coffee sometimes. Some say the Sette isn't a good choice for drip. Would you rather recommend keeping the Preciso for a nice drip coffee? Selling it? Getting another grinder? (I guess it's a good investment as you're having coffee every day and using it for years)",1612129864

Coffee,silent_femme,l9i2wi,"Thanks to James Hoffmann, my Nespresso game has vastly improved, lol, hear me out guys","So first off, I’m a long time member of this sub, and have learned so much about coffee because of you guys. Prior to joining this sub, all I knew about making coffee at home was the dosage to use: 2 TB ground, store bought, coffee to 6oz water. In this would go into my Mr Coffee coffee maker, and with a little flavored creamer and sugar, I had my morning coffee fix. 

Fast forward a few years later, I’m buying third wave coffee beans, I weaned off creamer and sugar and I’m drinking coffee black, bought a Comandante hand grinder, a digital scale, Fellow Stagg kettle, V60, Kalita Wave, French Press... I’m all in and in love with coffee. My morning coffee routines have become a ritual. I no longer drink it for its effects, I drink it because it tastes good.   

So prior to the pandemic, I would also frequent local coffee shops to drink the occasional cappuccino, Cortado, or just a double espresso after lunch, and my love for espresso started to grow just as quickly as my love for drip. Knowing how expensive an espresso setup would be at home, I decided not go that route and continue making pour-overs at home, and have my espresso at the cafes. 

Then once the pandemic hit, and coffee shops closed their doors, there was an emptiness inside me that I needed to fill, and that’s when I started researching espresso machine and watching James Hoffmann’s espresso guides, first one being on dosage. I didn’t want to go the capsule route, but I also didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole of espresso machines, because I just didn’t have the time, money, or real estate on my countertop for new coffee gear.   

So I settled on the Nespresso Essenza Mini because it was small, compact, made nothing but espresso, and they have a line of Single Origin coffees capsules, that also happen to be recyclable. Once I brought it home I “pulled” or made my first shot of Ethiopia and noticed it was weak and sour. At first this bummed me out, but then I remembered Hoffmann’s video about espresso dosage, and after reading the owner’s manual, I figure out I can adjust the amount of water that comes of my machine. So I grabbed my digital scale, did a little research of how much coffee is in each capsule, 8-10g, then made the necessary adjustments to the machine to pull a 2:1 shot. This also meant I had to use 2 capsules for a double shot, which means I’ll have to go through more capsules than I originally thought, but at this point I didn’t care, I just want to make this thing work. 

The shot was perfect. It had just the right amount of sweetness, body, and acidity you’d expect from good espresso. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best single origin espresso  I’ve drank from a coffee shop, and 5 being coffee chain espresso, I’d rank it at a solid 8. I was incredibly happy with the results, and given the circumstances we’re in, I’d rather have a quick shot of espresso at home in my demitasse, than drink it out of a to-go cup from a coffee shop. 

So thank you all for introducing me to this wonderful world of coffee, and I hope you all are enjoying a great cup of coffee, wherever you are in the world.",1612116798

Coffee,dennison,l9h278,Trouble dialing - Breville Barista Express,"I am trying to dial in some freshly roasted beans (medium roast). I'm using the Breville Barista Express, single wall double shot portafilter.

Extraction tine is always around 10 seconds from the first drop (not including pre-infusion).

Beans - 16 grams
Target yield: 32 grams
Extraction time: 10 seconds

Results are a bit sour, under-extracted and not smooth at all. I tried dialing the grind size all the way to the finest setting (1), but extraction time still won't go up.

I have no trouble extracting with the pressurized (dual wall) filters.

Coffee,meowmeowjeff,l9fwjw,V60 - Drawdown time decreases with a finer grind?,"I've been brewing with a V60 for about a little over a month now. Mostly using the Hoffman technique. I've been pretty successful at it for the most part. Light roasts are a bit tricky to nail, but I've had some pretty great brews overall.

However, my most recent coffee purchase has left me utterly defeated. I can't seem to do anything right with it. It's almost like I completely forgot how to brew coffee. I don't understand. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I am at my wits end.

I'm following the Hoffman technique almost to the letter. This has worked for me brilliantly time and time again. I've found good success with using 2.5 rotations on my grinder as a starting point. Maybe a few clicks to really dial things in. Brewing \~1/16. Usually 32g coffee to 500g water.

So I grind my coffee and brew. Business as usual. That is, until my drawdown finishes at \~3:05. Coffee tasted very under extracted. I know the drill, two clicks finer, grind, brew. \~3:02. Rinse and repeat a couple more times, each time a little finer. Each time the drawdown is a little quicker. I have a flat coffee bed when all is said and done. No obvious signs of channeling. I just don't understand. Should the drawdown time not increase as the grind gets finer? This last brew seemed entirely too fine. About half a rotation finer than my typical grind setting.

Please help, I just want my morning coffee.

Coffee,lunaverse13,l9fp83,Breville 870XL: solenoid questions,"I have a 5 year old machine, and have researching posts and watching an exhausting number of videos, we’ve determined the issue is the solenoid (very loud buzzing, low pressure). The solenoid valve assembly that needs to be replaced is out of stock everywhere. There aren’t any parts available locally. I have a couple of questions moving forward:
1.  I’ve watched videos that recommended cleaning the solenoid valve assembly. Is it a matter of taking out the assembly and dismantling it before cleaning?  Some videos literally drop the entire assembly into a bowl of citric acid solution. 
2.  If that doesn’t work, and I have to purchase a new 3 way valve, how do I determine what to buy?  The OEM part is not anywhere to be found. How do I figure out which valve will work as a replacement? The stamped info on the valve is all Greek to me.

Coffee,MokaMaker,l9f3a2,Why are espresso machines so expensive?,"I’m looking to buy a single group head espresso machine for myself for at home use and maybe small functions. I realised espresso machines are expensive but WTF! Why is it necessary for a machine that simply heats up water, pushes out water at pressures and blows steam to cost me half a year of university fees? Then I haven’t even bought a grinder yet. The cheapest option I’ve found so far is literally only the Breville barista express or the Rancillio Silvia and both of them are still about 10-15k rands which is an absurd amount of money. I’ve even looked at second hand machines on facebook and people are even more ridiculous with their prices there! They buy a machine 5 years ago and then expect only a very minor price drop even though it’s 5 years old.

Sorry for the rant but it’s just so frustrating. I’m a barista and know how these machines work and all of them work the same and only have minor things that are better with the more expensive models. I don’t know how someone is supposed to afford these machines except if you have huge amounts of money just lying around.",1612108765

Coffee,jasonmaska,l93y3i,Advice Needed: Baratza Encore Grind Sizes for Chemex,"So, as it goes, I've had quite a bit of trouble dialing in the precise grind size for my chemex using my Baratza Encore.  I've been getting cups that have come out as sour, bitter, or a combination of sour and bitter.  I'm used to a crisp, acidic, citrusy smell coming from a chemex, like I would when walking into a coffee shop.  With my coffee grounds, it usually smells spicy and burnt.

I'm fully aware of the recommendation by the vendor to use the size 20 for chemex, but I've also heard wildly different suggestions.  Some videos have suggested sizes ranges of 16-19, others 20-22 and some even higher.  I've personally sent in my unit to be repaired to Baratza themselves to which they've recalibrated my grinder and suggested going even higher, to 25-30.  I've heard from the Onyx video to have a grind size similar to a size of a number on a penny -- which is one of the more elaborate descriptions.  A local coffee shop suggested the size of coarse sea salt.  I've also heard people say that everyone's Baratza could be slightly different and grind size will vary, etc.

Luckily, that same coffee shop I mentioned above was nice enough to give me some throwaway beans to use to dial in my grind size.  I've attached multiple photos a paper labeled with grind sizes 16 through 25 on my specific Baratza Encore.  I've realized while running my finger through the grounds that it seems like quite a few fine grounds get through on this grinder, and I'm not really sure what I can do to help it.

I've tried many different batches and recipes and just can't seem to hit it on the nail.  I used to brew with a strict 1:15 method using 40g of coffee and 600g of water; aiming for a 4:30-5 minute brew time.  I've been told to go with smaller batches, so I've been testing out 25g of coffee with 400g of water (1:16 method); a 3:15-3:30 brew time.  I've even tried out the large-batch onyx method of 55g of coffee with 900g of water; a 5:30-6:00, or up to 7:00 brew time.  For each method, I try to stick to a 0:45 bloom, but I'm not sure if that means I should be seeing constant bubbling in the grounds.  I'd say that if I only went with how much bubbling I see, it should be closer to 0:30.  Though there's a lot of methods out there and I've heard anywhere from 0:30 to 1:30. No matter what I try, I seem to have little luck.

Given my experiment, my eyes tell me to dial in around 22-24 on the encore, which would be around 22 for a 20-30g batch, 23 for a 30-40g batch or 24 for a 40g+ batch.  

I'm hoping for some advice on what's worked for you and what you think from the photos.  Anywhere from the best grind size, batch size, brew times, pouring methods, filters, water temperature, etc. is welcomed when it comes to Chemex.

It feels like I've tried everything and I'm at the point where I'm thinking that something in my house is significantly impacting the coffee flavor, to which I have no real basis on.  I just moved two years ago and felt like I've been able to make coffee fine before, but since I've been working from home during the pandemic, I've maybe just spent a lot of time diagnosing potential flaws here.  I've lived in a suburb 50 miles away and in a college town in central Illinois and had no issues there, and actually significantly better coffee.

As far as equipment goes, these are a few things I have at my disposal:

\- Bleached Chemex filters, but I also have natural brown filters

\- Electric kettle (typically at 205 degrees), using water through a brita filter (and my tap water comes from Chicago)

\- Baratza Encore

\- Lido 2 hand grinder (though I'm trying to dial in grind size better on the encore before experimenting with this again)

\- Third Wave Water packets &amp; Distilled Water, though I didn't notice any difference when I used this, so I've been sticking to the filtered water

\- Hario V60 Scale

\- Some fresh bags of coffee roasted a few days ago

Coffee,Klutzy_Internet_4716,l93iig,Recommendation for inexpensive burr hand grinder with removable burr?,"Hi, coffee lovers, I figure it's high time I get a good grinder (or grinders), and since I love both French press and Turkish coffee, I don't have a huge budget, and I'm only making coffee for myself, I'm thinking I want a manual one. But none of the grinders I've found say that you can remove the burr, and some even say that you never want to let any water get on it. I would worry about the flavor of stale coffee getting in the fresh coffee you're grinding that day--and if you ever want to add cardamom to your coffee, then all coffee thereafter would taste faintly of increasingly-stale cardamom. The obvious solution would be to just get a grinder with a removable and washable burr.

Can any of you make any recommendations? Or am I just thinking about this entirely wrong?",1612064077
Coffee,Acavia8,l922j3,Interesting article on fines,"[http://coffeenavigated.net/grinder/fines/](http://coffeenavigated.net/grinder/fines/)

&amp;#x200B;

Article on testing how fines affect a brewed coffee.  Interesting conclusions: 1) when fines are mixed with rest of grinds, they cling fairly well to large grinds acting as bigger grinds, producing more optimal coffee.  2) separating them from rest of grind, but leaving them in the grind bed leads to over extraction, 3) sieving fines out causes lackluster coffee and 4) Bloom might be causing fines to gel to larger particles - this last part has me wanting to lower my normal 3:1 bloom to 2:1 to lessen fines washing away from larger particles.",1612059416

Hello, I enjoy coffee but I'm relatively new to it. When making coffee at home I've really only bought Starbucks and Seattle's Best beans. Seattle's best was horrible and I think I stopped halfway through the bag when I realized I just couldn't make it taste good. I enjoy the Starbucks most of the time I make it. I get the Caffè Verona, or French Roast bags, both are labeled as dark roasts. 

**I'm afraid to branch out and pay more for something I'll end up not enjoying, like I did with Seattle's Best. Are there any fairly cheap ground-beans that rival or beat Starbucks? If not what should my ""next step up"" be?** I'm sure I would enjoy some really $$$ coffee but I also can't afford to drink that everyday (sadly).

Thank you!

p.s. If it makes a big difference I use a french press. Used to use the Hoffman method but I couldn't make it not bitter, so now I just incorporate his method of not plunging all the way and just pouring.",1612052529

So the first thing I've been trying to master is a cappuccino, and I usually make 2 at once. For the milk I use a 600ml jug and fill it up to 200ml with 2% milk, make sure I hear the proper sound when it's frothing (according to some YouTube tutorials) and make sure to tap it to get the bubbles out. Usually the first cappuccino is the right consistency but I find that when I go to pour the second one, the milk doesn't seem frothed and tastes watery, as if I just poured in regular milk instead of frothed milk.

I tried transferring the milk from one jug to another to mix up the milk better but the same ends up happening. I've also tried sticking the frother in deeper after the first bit of frothing near the surface to make sure that the bottom milk gets frothed too but once again I get the same results. What could I be doing wrong? Do I need to froth the milk for each cappuccino one at a time? I realize it's difficult to offer advice without seeing how exactly I froth the milk, but nevertheless I'd be grateful for any tips!",1612051616
Coffee,spacejumbofudge,l8zghy,UK Fresh Italian Espresso bean recommendation,"Hi, I've had a Gaggia Classic Pro for the last month or so having moved from Nespresso.  I can't pretend I haven't found it incredibly hard.  I've had some good espresso, but mostly sour and acidic shots.  Doesn't help I like my coffee as Espresso, no milk or sugar to hide anything.

I'm wondering if the beans aren't helping me - I started with supermarket stuff to learn, got some fresh stuff from a London roaster gifted - but not what I'd choose and not really for espresso.  Then I tried a couple from Decadent Decaf - the espresso and sumatra.  Still fighting to get away from the sour/acid taste.

Can anyone recommend some reliable fresh Italian Espresso beans I can easily get in the UK so I can at least take the beans out of the equation in working out what's going wrong.  Ideally both normal and decaf.

My setup: Gaggia Classic Pro (fit the 9 bar mod today), Eureka Mignon Specialta grinder.  VST 15 and 18 g baskets (have been dosing at 14g in the 15g basket hoping that will increase the extraction and reduce the acid/sour).

From a price point, it  seems the GCP w/ OPV and PID mods will come out to be around $650 ($500  for the Thunder Black color GCP, $135 for PID, $15 for OPV kit), while  the CC1 v2 sits at around $699. For me personally, I don't think I'd  want to void the warranty on my GCP and tinker around with adding the  PID.

So when I found the CC1 v2,  which comes standard with features such as a PID and pre-infusion for a  similar price point, it made me wonder if this might be the better  machine for me.

Now my question...

So, around a year ago I found this sub and dove into the world of coffee. I often saw Happy Mug and S&amp;W Roasting mentioned a lot so those have always been my go-to roasters and I couldn't be happier with their stuff.

I've always been eager to try different roasters like Vibrant, Onyx etc. but I just can't justify spending almost 3x the price for coffee 
when the stuff I'm brewing is already seemingly good.

Coffee,asoap,l8qt70,Is there a v60 paper that's more like a cloth filter? As in less of a filter.,"Let me explain. 

I just used a metal filter on my v60.  I knew it was going to give me more solids in my coffee and I really enjoyed it!  But it's a bit too much.  I want a bit of a middle ground between the metal filter which lets through a lot of solids and oils and a normal v60 paper.  My understanding is that middle ground is a cloth filter.  

Now I don't want the hassle that comes with a cloth filter.  I'm lazy.  I've actually been sitting on the metal filter for months because I didn't want the extra inconvenience of cleaning it.  

Is there any other options?  Like does anyone make a v60 paper that let's through more solids/oils?  Like a v60 paper that's perferatted?  Or perhaps a metal filter that's closer to a paper filter?",1612028102
Coffee,Mack_24,l8qexq,How to Fix Bland Coffee? (Coming from High Quality Beans),"So I've been brewing for about a month now, and pretty much all of my free time has been spent towards learning about coffee. Either by experimenting at home, or doing research online. 

This has led me to some great cups, but when it comes to brewing amazing cups constantly, I'm definitely not where I want to be. 

This being said, I just got a bag of Black and White's Gesha Village - Honey and I haven't been able to get the notes on the bag whatsoever. It is described as having notes of bergamot, dried mango, ripe papaya, and wildflower honey. But every brew has been fairly bland or uninspiring. This happened with a bag of The Future from B&amp;W as well.

I have dialed it in with grind size such that there is no bitterness or sour tastes. I know that bland can sometimes be a result of underextraction, but grinding one setting finer on my Encore with M2 burrs gives me some unwanted bitterness. 

Speaking of equipment, I'm using:
Baratza Encore with M2 burrs
Plastic v60 with brown v60 brand filters
198° Third Wave Water (that's the hottest I can get without boiling, here at 7000 ft elevation) 

And my method has been:
Preheat v60 and rinse filter, pour out rinse water,
20 grams of coffee in,
50 gram bloom for 45 seconds, briefly stirring with a spoon,
@0:45 concentric pour to 150g total,
@1:30 concentric pour to 250g total,
Once brew bed is just visible through the water pour to 310g total then a spin to even the grounds
Brew time has ended at about 3:30

I tried more agitation the last few times by pouring more quickly, and that has helped some, but I'm still not tasting the bright, delicious flavors that I want. 

How do I beat this bland brew?",1612027077

2: 90% sure it's a New York State coffee company and 70% sure it's not in the metro region.

3: They also made cans of coffee sold in 4-packs. Small cans, maybe 4-6oz.

Coffee,andrei-dreamwhale,l6b601,"Specialty Coffee scene in Lisbon &amp; Porto, Portugal","Hey guys,

Based on brief browsing I've noticed that the subject had been popping up, but never properly developed, so I thought it's worth giving it a shot again.

Despite strong scepticism, specialty coffee scene that was believed to be obsolete, has not only survived but kept evolving and growing stronger. Although it still is a miserably small share of the market in comparison with local commercial leather-n-coal robusta dealers, some things started happening: 2 Aeropress Competitions, a Coffee Festival where specialty roasters were given a ground next to big players, chain specialty coffeeshops, an actual stable coffee community, and 2 completely different coffee capitals - turf-obsessed Lisbon and welcoming laid-back Porto.

To kickstart the thread I'll just go with my Lisbon favorites:

* [Roastberry Coffee Lab](https://roastberry.pt/en/product-category/shop/cafe/) \- reliable roasting consistency, Q-grader on board, great bean selection, got their CoE El Salvador - was a tropical banger, also had another gem from El Salvador - natural SL28.
* Olisipo - know them personally, a sweet team of two. Great roast, good converstions, impressive selection.
* Wow Coffee Roasters - a tad cringy name hides awfully good bean selection.
* Brava, Sgt Martinho, Academia de Cafe, Fabrica, etc.

And those would be just the roasting companies - there are dozens of new specialty/3rd wave coffeeshops that have opened over last 3 years representing either the local or european roasters.

Things are happening and it would be cool to see what you guys think. Cheers!",1611772148

Coffee,harpua_dog,l5ghqd,Bonavita drip woes,"Greetings sub, I’m not a regular coffee subreddit guy so my apologies if this belongs in the Daily Thread.

I’ve had a Bonavita BV-1800-TH for 6 years now and it’s a great machine - usually. Every 2-4 months or so it decides to overflow and make coffee all over my kitchen. Over the years, I’ve discovered many “solutions” to this issue: less water, less coffee, carefully filling the basket ensuring no grounds get under the filter cone, different brands of coffee, different grinds (currently 22 on the Baratza Encore grinder)... my theory is the coffee is blooming up in the basket and floating up and over the paper filter then clogging the basket hole. Thinking it was the excessive bloom of freshly ground coffee, I’ve taken to pre-grinding a week or so of coffee and storing that in an airtight container. This appeared to work for a while, but, like all my solutions, it always ends in a counter full of coffee and grounds.

The only foolproof safe method for me is to stop the machine about halfway through its cycle, wait a few minutes, then continue. Of course, I am very lazy and would prefer not to babysit the machine every brew.

Is this a known issue with this machine? Are there other quality drip machines that deal with bloom better? This machine makes great coffee and I still like it despite the bi-monthly coffee floods, but I’m willing to spend more money now to fix the issue if there are alternatives.

     I have recently acquired a V60 2 cup brewer. I have had hit or miss brews with the brewer. Now I know that it's entirely user error because I know it can make great coffee. My problem is that I can't seem to nail a great grind size for it.

When I see a tutorial video on YouTube, someone like James Hoffmann who I know, knows what he's doing. His grind size is larger than mine. I know that because I can see larger pieces that look far coarser than my much fluffier looking grind.

I know that the brew should be somewhere around 3:30-4:00 mins for a brew. The best I seem to be able to do is just over 3mins long. And I'm grinding rather fine, I'm trying to pour as gently as possible but still providing enough water to sufficiently keep water in the brewer, covering the coffee. The brews are usually just over 3 mins and are almost always underextrcted and weak.

I aim for a 20g to 280ml brew. Though I've try anywhere from 18-22g to try and change the extraction ratio. But it still seems to have little effect.

What are your recommendations and thoughts on how I can improve my brews? Any recommendation is appreciated, I'm by no means set in my ways of using the brewer.

At this point I have a distribution technique down where I kind of shake/tap the portafilter to settle the grounds evenly, use a distribution tool, and then tamp. So I’m wondering if there’s an issue with the machine’s water flow that causes it to drip from the left of the puck...

Already did the OPV mod to 10 bars of pressure. Any input is appreciated!",1611621036

Coffee,valsidalv,l507wp,First burr grinder: Baratza or Breville?,"I brew coffee every morning using a moka pot and my blade grinder. I recently began following James Hoffmann's [tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7d-5KWHCU) for getting better-tasting coffee using a blade grinder, and the results are astounding. So, now it's time to step up to a proper burr grinder. I will continue to use my moka pot and may end up buying an entry-level espresso machine later on.

I wanted to keep the costs low but things snowballed and I eventually settled on parting with $360 CAD for a Baratza Sette 30. A quick search on camelcamelcamel reveals that the price of this grinder remains quite steady, so I don't expect a sale on it anytime soon.

Just as I was about to buy it, I saw an ad for the Breville Smart Grinder Pro, now discounted to $240 CAD. I'm familiar with the Breville from reviews I've watched and considered it as well, but I preferred the look and performance of the Sette 30. However, now that there is a significant price difference between the two grinders I am wondering if the Breville is simply a better buy? What would you choose?",1611616216

Coffee,TheFlaskjar,l4yohe,Niche Zero and Barista Express Shot Quality Potential,"Hi Guys, I was just wondering about the potential for good espresso using a Barista Express and the Niche.

I got the Barista Express about 2 years ago to save money on coffee shop flat whites (it backfired 😂), but soon side stepped milk drinks and have been making filter coffee with a commandante for about 18 months. I use chemically ideal water, know about extraction principles, buy nice high-grown beans and like to nerd out on the pour-overs.

However, I’ve just got a Niche Zero this week, and now I’ve got a perfectly good, stepless espresso grinder, I’ve been thinking about getting into speciality espresso for the first time.

I just wondered from anyone who has the Barista Express but upgraded their grinder, whether you’re able to get shots comparable to something like the Breville/Sage Dual Boiler or Lelit Bianca (or something else $1000-2000) after a bit of preheating and grouphead flushing? Or would I be best off spending some more money on a better machine?

Thanks in advance.",1611611859
Coffee,P4ULUS,l4xqxw,Moccamaster vs Drip: My Experience,"Background:

I’ve been preparing single cup pour over coffee for years as I prefer the pure taste of pour over to machine brewing methods. Recently, I splurged on a Moccamaster as I thought a machine would save time in preparing coffee each morning for my partner and I as stirring and pouring the drip is time consuming. We consume about three 6-8 ounce cups total between us each day.

Moccamaster Review:

This is a nice coffee maker. Don't get me wrong. Moccamaster makes good coffee and produces said coffee quite quickly once loaded up so make no mistake about that. However, I will be returning my Moccamaster and reverting back to pour over methods. Here's why:

1) Cheap plastic parts and design shortcomings. As others have mentioned, many of the Technivorm pieces are flimsy plastic afterthoughts that don't give using this machine a high-end feel. The funnel cover and hot water dripper can be easily knocked out of place and the pot itself scrapes the heating plate when put beneath the dripper. It gets annoying needing to be so careful to collect the parts properly and not break or displace anything. 
2) Water basin is not removable. As far as cleaning goes, it's not straightforward as the water basin is screwed in. I understand the thinking here - it's only purified water that goes in there so why clean it? Would be better if this was removable.
3) Inefficiency. Probably the biggest issue for us. With the Moccamaster versus a pourover, I found we needed 7-8 double tablespoon scoops (~16 tablespoons) for 2-3 cups of coffee vs 12 tablespoons using a Chemex pour over for the same number of cups. I was using way more coffee with the moccamaster compared with pourover methods as the drip method is simply not as efficient. This issue is not unique to the moccamaster but there are likely smarter machines at saturating the grounds. 
4) The two-setting hot plate functionality is problematic because it's always on when the coffee maker is on meaning the coffee is constantly heating up in the pot while the funnel is still dripping. When making a bigger pot (8+ cups), the coffee ends up tasting overheated.
5) No timer. A $300 coffee makers should have a timer or at least more features than simply dripping hot water over coffee beans. 

Results:
For me, the best solution I’ve found is a Chemex. A large pour over apparatus provides some added efficiency versus a single cup pour over while retaining the same great taste and overall process control. We bought a Chemex and will continue with pour over.

Interested to hear others thoughts and experiences with expensive coffee machines vs pour over. For us, we simply didn’t find the time savings that we’d hoped for. Thanks!",1611609298

Coffee,Wendy888Nyc,l4v8pa,"Does doing a pourover into a mug stop air flow from escaping, therefore affecting the drawdown?","So I didn't make this up; it was included in a recent brewing video from a reputable source. But I'm skeptical- is a carafe or a mug with a lip needed to optimize a pourover? Can brewing into a regular mug really stop airflow and affect drawdown?

I know people have reasons for brewing into a carafe- multiple servings, temperature considerations, anesthetic, etc. I brew for one and like brewing into my mug. I mix with a spoon as soon as the brew is finished, so no issue with that. I can also swirl a mug if I want to. (I've just ordered a glass mug so I can see the process better). Nothing about using a mug bothers me. I don't want to purchase a new carafe to clean after every brew, if it's not going to improve my pourover

I take 2 caffeine pills at a time to get me going for the whole day, which is 12.5 cents worth of pills, for 2-4 cups of coffee worth of caffeine. 

So while you get the same amount of caffeine with $4-8 worth of coffee, I get that level of caffeine for 32-64x less than that cost. (4/.125=32, 8/.125=64)

* Is it true that beans from origin A produce more fines than those from origin B?
* What effect does the roast level, days past roast, etc. have on the grind quality?

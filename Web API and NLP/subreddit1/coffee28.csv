Coffee,Nbc27,kwcmgk,Iced Coffee,"After struggling to figure out how to make iced coffee. I’ve decided the best way is too brew the night before and then chill in the fridge in a mason jar. I decided to switch to my Keurig with a reusable mesh filter (I’m starting to think drip coffee for this is a better idea lol) and I’ve noticed when I wake up the bottom of the jar will have “sludge”. 

Now normally when I wake up I just shake the coffee up so it disappears and then begin making the iced drink. 

So A. Is shaking coffee problematic (flavor wise kind of like soda). And B. Is there even a reason to want the “sludge” or should I leave it at the bottom of the jar.

Coffee,davidb2002,kwc8vo,Trouble brewing with Salter EK3131,"Hi Guys,

I bought a Salter EK3131 a few months ago to replace my AeroPress as I wanted something that automated the process a little more. I wasn't expecting anything amazing for the price and expected that I would need to tweak to taste. However, I just can't quite seem to figure out where i'm going wrong.

I'm using the same beans Lavazza Espresso Italiano Coffee Beans and the same amount of beans ( the recommend amount for an Aeropress).  


With the Aeropress, the coffee was darker in colour and richer in flavour. The smell is usually rich and lovely like a coffee shop.  
With the Salter, the coffee is lighter in colour and taste more burny/bitter. The smell is also more bitter/burnt.   


I initially thought it was the grind, so I made it finer first, which seemed to increase the burn and started making it more course. It's still more fine than the Aeropress, and the taste has improved, but it still lacks flavour, lighter in colour and has a slight taste of bitter and water.  


Any suggestions thanks! I don't know if i'm putting to much water, beans or if the grind is off.",1610525878

The Niche would be \~$750 and the Specialita would be \~$500. From what I've read, the main differences seem to be flat vs conical burrs, slightly lower retention and easier grind adjustments on the niche. So in terms of quality, it seems like the Specialita may be slightly better due to flat burrs(?), however, I'm still a novice so I'm sure I won't be able to tell the difference for now. And the convenience and ease-of-use goes to the Niche. However, I want to confirm if this is truly the case for individuals that may have done research or have owned both machines. If so, is the Niche Zero worth $250 more?

Coffee,aSneakyBagel,kvy5q5,My new 1Zpresso JX makes an awful sound when removing/attaching the bottom chamber,"Just received my 1Zpresso JX - my first coffee grinder.

I’ve watched a few videos of the grinder being used and it doesn’t make the same noise 

I’ve not actually used the grinder yet but would assume it still works as expected. I’ve emailed 1Zpresso who have advised that it’s not a common issue and it could be worth using a small amount of cooking oil on both parts - I’m slightly reluctant to do this because I think I’d have to do it fairly frequently, and I wouldn’t want it to impact the bean flavours.

Coffee,-gero-,kvxdb4,Better grind consistency on cheap hand grinders,"Just a quick tip I figured out last week that rapidly improved my cups. I own a Hario Skerton Plus and while it has a stabilizing plate built-in, I still find it yields pretty inconsistent results for coarser settings. 

Before, I always lifted it up and just turned the handle until it's finished. What I didn't know was how much the position in which you hold the handle affects the result. Holding it more upwards or downwards tilts the burr and makes some beans far too coarse while others end up far too fine. 

Now, I try to hold the handle as much in place as possible by dragging it outside, orthogonal to the grinder. I also find that turning it too slow or too fast makes it hard to keep the angle so there is a sweet spot that is probably different for everyone.

This technique particularly resulted in less filter clogging, presumably because there are less fine grounds, and has made my coffee routine much more enjoyable.

My question for you, are there similar tweaks that I might not be aware of to get the most out of cheaper hand grinders?",1610475943

I’ve been buying pre-ground coffee from as many different roasters as I can, but I’m worried that the grind isn’t a variable I can control as much in this scenario, so I’d like to give this a go myself. 

So with that in mind, I’m looking for a grinder, either hand or electric, whichever I can get the best bang for my buck. My budget is around £100, but don’t mind stretching that a little bit, if it means I’m getting a far better product. 

I’m the only one in the house who drinks coffee, so I don’t need to grind huge amounts at once.

Coffee,redsunstar,kvvzhk,How often do you fail to entirely saturate the bloom by swirling (V60)?,"This is mostly a question about the mechanics of the swirl and what can affect it. 

I've noticed when I used the Hoffmann V60 method that it could be somewhat inconsistent. One of the reasons for that inconsistency was that sometimes the coffee bed failed to be entirely saturated during the bloom phase. Even after five to ten vigorous swirls, I could be left with coffee clinging to the filter, refusing to mix in an homogeneous slurry and some water sitting on top.

Here are some of the factors that impact this uneven saturation:

- Coffees that produce a lot of fines are more difficult to mix

- Coffee that is ground finer can be harder to saturate. These days I grind quite fine, so that's an issue for me. 

- Not swirling vigorously enough.

- Not pouring vigorously enough.

- The divot at the centre is not deep enough (grounds at the bottom don't get mixed in the slurry), the divot at the centre is too deep (water flows through too quickly)

- Excessively compacting some grinds while I'm making a divot. 

Once I have gotten to know how a specific bean behaves, it can be quite consistent, but I usually only stay with a bag a short while. So, because of that initial variability, I have switched to stirring like a mad lad with a teaspoon, that works well for me, takes care of my previous reproducibility issues and gives me delicious coffees.

Still, many people seem to prefer the swirl method taste wise. Have any of you dealt with unevenly saturated grounds during the bloom phase? How common or uncommon an issue is this for you? What factors have you found impact even saturation? How do you deal with it?",1610471985

The advice you get on this sub for some questions can be infuriating. Recently I've been trying to make my V60 cups brighter, so I searched posts with people asking the same question.

Hell, even the 2 biggest names in the game, Hoffman and Rao, might not exactly contradict each other, but still have differing advice.

All the opposing views are sort of turning me off instead of making me want to try every single method.

Coffee,FreshEelJam,kvokyq,Anaerobic Brazilian coffees tasting awful?,"I've had a few coffees recently which are anaerobic natural coffees from Brazil, from different producers. 

Even around 3 weeks after roast they are still regularly tasting awful - I can't describe exactly what the profile is but it's actively not usual for coffees of that type - it's quite vegetal and stale. My husband eloquently put it, ""tastes like hot ass"".

Sometimes however the coffees brewed with it (V60 primarily) taste absolutely fine. Not special, not a lot of origin characteristics, but normal coffee taste. It appears to be a cross section of beans in the bag are contributing this but not the whole bag. 

Has anyone else had this experience, any ideas as to solutions / causes etc please?",1610444364

-recent service with full service pack fitted

Does anyone have any ideas or solutions?

Coffee,_0110111001101111_,kvo0vz,How often do you have to re-zero a grinder? Is this normal?,"I purchased a 1ZPresso JX Pro back in October and I realised today while adjusting for a new coffee that the zero has slipped from 0 (it came properly zeroed from the factory) by about 2~ clicks and it now zeroes at 2 clicks past 9. The grind quality hasn’t been affected and I decided if I have to re-zero it, I may as well clean it. The burrs and everything else look immaculate so I’m not worried about any damage there. 

I’m just wondering if it’s normal for there to be slight slippage over time - I grind 30g of coffee a day and I’ve been doing so since October so the grinder is definitely seasoned. Cause for concern or am I overthinking this?

Coffee,LeBigMac84,kvnxve,I had so many great cups the last days,"All thanks to the aeropress. I was almost exclusively brewing with French press the last 6 years, some mocca pot some v60 experiments and I was very happy with the cup I was getting.

Now I got an aeropress because I got a coupon and thought to myself hell why not.

Simply amazing. 10 cups, 10 different recipes, 10 times a different product. Right this morning I made a cup that tasted like a very clean and rich French press cup. Recipe for anyone interested:

Regular method
250g 90°
40 second bloom with 60grams of water
Fill up to 250g
Stir once
Wait 90 seconds and press

I thought I was getting some weird exotic tool, yet this is the easiest method to a great cup.",1610441148

But I can't seem to get the single-serve to work, and the directions aren't clear (enough for me). 

At first, I put my k-cup in the little gray holder, and it exploded once I hit brew. Also saw that the top was punctured by the holder, but there was no puncture in the bottom. Then I put the k-cup in without the gray holder, and went to brew, and saw that the bottom nor the top of the k-cup was ever punctured. 

What am I missing? Do I need to do something to activate the needle? Do I use the grey pod to put the k-cup into? Why isn't it puncturing? I totally feel that this operator error vs machine error, but the instructions aren't helping!",1610427188

Coffee,Lomandriendrel,kvhqnm,Breville barista express 870 - cleaned burrs,"Hi all

First time poster. Couldn't  find a post on this issue so wondering if it's  an easy fix. I recently got a barista  express 870 in december. After playing around abit after struggling  on getting timing right ive finally landed on a grind of around 2-3 that worked consistently with our coffee beans: using a single wall double filter i got about 8 secs preinfusions and a total of usually 28-33sec shots  (including pre infusion) which i presume is ""ok""? It was good enough for the mrs anyhow.  Come sunday i did my first clean of the burrs. Removed the top burr with the metal bar (gosh its hard to turn. Thought id snap the metal handle lifter) and used the brush to brush the inside and top burr of the coffee dust.   

Come today ive used it for the first time. Same beans. Never moved the grind dial. Got 6 secs pre infusion and an under extraxted pressure. Whole thing flushed  out in 18 secs or less. Thought id gotten too soft with the tamp but after doing 2 more attempts ive gotten similar results . Even under  tamping in the past ive not had this short of a time. I did feel the grind is suddenly more coarse and sand like.

Is it common to remove the burrs  and have the coarseness suddenly increase? Do i need to lock it into place  even  tighter (top burr - it's  in lock position but i found it quite hard to clockwise turn into this position) to revert it back to how it was grinding pre clean? Or is there some other setting when brush cleaning  i could have physically inadvertently  changed?

On another note  presuming i can get the grinding/ extraction back  to pre clean levels...any advice out of the 3 variables  to adjust: coffee grind, coffee quantity and tamping pressure - what do i change to lower pre infusion  time yet keep extraction post infusion   time the same? Ive found the only way pre infusion drops to 6s which is where some recommend (from my 8-9 secs) is when tamping lighter or less coffee but both result in a shorter extraction time. Tamping harder lengthens the extraction time naturally but bumps up the pre infusion time? Im struggling on how to get the 6 sec magical pre infusion window yet  still hit that 20-28 sec extraction  time people recommend? I just use the double espresso auto button (so no manual espresso).

Also my barista said to use a double walled filter  always but the manual  recommenda single wall as double wall is for pre ground etc? Curious  if barista or manual is right?

Thanks for any advice",1610416790

Coffee,7DeadlyKnives,kvh6q6,Sort of a silly question but how should I adjust my French press recipe if I’m upgrading mug size from 14-20 Oz?,"I make a single cup of French press coffee daily on weekdays and 2 times a day on weekends. My ratio is 425G of water, 22G of whole beans. I always drink out of the same 14OZ mug and it’s just the right amount for the size. However I just started online school today and decided to to buy a 20 OZ mug instead since the 14OZ is finish within the first hour of my 3 hour class. 

Anyways my question is how should I adjust my recipe for a 20 Oz mug and keep the taste about the same? I have used different ratios in the past but none of them makes a better cup of coffee for me than the one I mentioned. I’m sure it can be duplicated to fit the size upgrade I’m just not sure how and afraid I may make a cup I’m unable to drink.",1610414857

Currently I am doing 4 cups coffee, roughly 2 to 2.5 cups of coconut and then 6 cups of water.

I thought I better check to see if my seals on my mason jar lids were still good and out of 5 that I submerged in water (empty) only 1 wasn‚Äôt allowing any air to escape.

I use a French Press and bottled spring water. I use one tablespoon of grounds per cup. I use a kettle on the stove to heat the water. No sugar, just one half-and-half creamer.

Coffee,mldsmith,l01uhn,V60/Niche Zero Grind Setting/Extraction Time,"Hi All,

Been playing around with pour over recently (I primarily drink espresso) as I really enjoy the clarity I get from cafes in town with their pour over offerings. I am struggling to recreate the same cup at home. I end up with what I perceive as over-extraction (bitter, too much body, muddy flavours) and a relatively long (4:00+) extraction time, wondering if the issue is grind time or technique, or something else.

Recipe: 20g coffee, 300g water (212F) 1:15 ratio medium roast blend [Longitude 123 from 49th Parallel Roasters](https://49thcoffee.com/collections/blends/products/123-w-longitude-blend)

Workflow: Preheat much and rinse/preheat ceramic V60 with hot tap water for a few minutes while kettle heats up. When kettle comes to temp grind beans (I have been grinding around step 40 - between ""filter drip"" and ""coarse"" settings, dose into V60 and dig a little hole in the middle. Bloom 60g water, give a little swirl, let sit for 45s. Slowly pour in circles to 200g or so over the next 45-60s, let draw down to just above the coffee bed, slowly pour up to 300g, swirl again (maybe 3 total rotations) and let it draw down. I get some stalling where flow slows a lot for the last 50g of water or so. 

Any feedback? I had this in the 49th parallel cafe and it was really bright, ""tea like"", with notes of apple and nuts. I get a lot of bitterness and not as much acidity in my cup.",1610998366

So I bought a large package of (supposedly?) Geisha beans from a different store, which was pretty pricey. How can I tell that I have real Geisha beans? Every brew I've tried, with different ratios, temperatures and coarseness tastes terrible. It's a bitter and sour, almost astringent, taste, no acidity and no sweetness whatsoever. Nothing like last time.

I tried extending brew time by making the grind finer, by adding more water (about 1:17), got it all the way to ~3.5min. Still, bitter/sour/astringent. Any tips before I call this wasted money? üôÇ",1610995812

I have a Breville Smart Grinder Pro, which I used to use (with good results) for espresso, but lately I have mostly switched over to V60 pourovers. I'm still struggling to understand the process of dialing in my grind for a particular coffee on the V60. One thing I've begun to suspect is that the grind quality is quite different if I single dose vs. loading the hopper and dosing based on grind time (and confirming with a scale). I'm guessing that this is due to the difference between all the beans being weighted down by the ones above in a timed grind, vs. the beans sort of bouncing around on the burrs in a single dose. I'd love to know if this is correct and what the difference in the grind and the resulting pourover would likely be? Thanks for any insight you all can provide.",1610994250

Coffee,yoked_shoat,kzzcwt,"How many people have found that exact ratios, water temps, brewing time etc. seem to be somewhat unimportant in the quality of coffee?","This isn't meant to dismiss the science/art of brewing in any way. I think the meticulous pursuit of the perfect cup of coffee is a valid one. I used to be really particular about my process. Recently however, I've become a bit more relaxed about the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been my morning routine for the past few months:

\-I just filled up my grinder to the top. No scale. Somewhere around 40 grounds, but could vary slightly. Put the grounds in the french press.

\-I boil water in the kettle and then wait for the bubbles to stop before I pour. Sometimes it's like 20 seconds. Sometimes I'm multitasking and I wait 45 seconds to a minute.

\-Fill the french press up with water till about the halfway point (500 grams but far from exact). Some days I want more coffee so I pour a little more water in. Maybe 2/3s full, so like 700 grams. I never compensate with more coffee because my grinder fits as much as it does and I'm always too lazy re-fill with beans and grind more.

\-Let it sit for at least 4 minutes and usually less than 10. But sometimes I forget about it while I'm doing something else and pour after 20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

AND DESPITE all of my inconsistency, the coffee I brew is consistently great. The only thing that seems to affect my coffee is the ingredients. Fresh beans and filtered water does the trick every time, no matter what else I change. 

Maybe my taste isn't refined enough to notice the small details that change  with each variation in the process. I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar. Let me know :)",1610991353

Makes amazing coffee, but filling it to the top only makes for a 350g cup of coffee. It claims to hold 20 oz but when you account for space at the top for the filter and space at the bottom for grounds, you are getting barely half that.

Then I bought the [Bialetti 3 cup moka pot](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Bialetti-Moka-Express-Stovetop/dp/B0000CF3Q6). I don't know why they would even claim '3 cups' when it makes 150g of coffee max. It's enough for one very small cup. Really it's more suited for a faux espresso.

Then I bought the [3 cup chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html). Makes about 500g of coffee, so maybe a cup and a half or two small cups. But any more than that and the filter will touch the water at the bottom. And the top is too small for anything larger than a 100g pour, so if you are trying to make larger batches you will have to do many pours, not ideal for pour over.

I got a bialetti 4-cup induction pot for christmas (which I LOVE).

The issue is that about 50% of the time I get a full top-pot of coffee, and 50% of the time it starts sputtering about half way.

My method is this:

1. Boil kettle with Brita filtered water
2. Grind 15g of coffee fresh using an Aergrind set to 1:3
3. Fill bottom chamber with 160-165g water (just below the valve)
4. Put coffee into basket &amp; level off (no tamping, just swiping my finger across a couple of times to make sure there isn't a mountain)
5. Screw top on and set burner to 4.5  (out of 9)
6. Wait for coffee - 5-6 minutes to see the flow start, maybe another 2-3 before sputtering.
7. Run the base under cold water to stop sputtering.

I was looking into making coffee at home because going to Starbucks gets prohibitively expensive over the long term. I got a moka pot a few months ago, but the time and attention it takes makes me skip it in the morning and I still haven't managed to make it taste very good at all.

I was looking into buying the Bonavita 1900TS (or 1500TS) and a Baritizia Encore Grinder or maybe the Harrio mini, but I read that without brewing at least a few cups at a time, there's no way it'll brew at the proper temperature to make the SCAA rating mean anything. Brewing more seems like a terrible waste as I would just throw it away. I was also thinking of possibly just buying a Nespresso machine for cheap since it would be single serving. (I am aware of the awful environmental impact of pod based systems)

I normally drink lattes, cappuccinos, and drip coffee with milk from Starbucks and even though its objectively probably ""bad"" coffee, I really do enjoy it. I'm also slightly worried getting a taste for ""good"" coffee will make me enjoy it less for getting coffee at places like Starbucks with friends or to meet people.

The quickest way, without needing to buy a stand-alone device, will probably be to set up a double boiler on the stove to heat the milk up. But that would require active involvement as I want the milk temp to fall within a certain range. I guess I could set up a thermometer to beep when it hits 145F?

Today, I tried to put the cold milk into the Ikea FP and sous vide it. Everything worked pretty well. The only downside of this is that it takes a while. Roughly 15 minutes for the water bath to reach 145, and another 10-15 minutes for the milk to reach temp. But minimal involvement needed and no chance of burning the milk by heating for too long.

Anyone have other methods for warming milk? I haven't tried the toaster oven yet as I think it would take longer than sous vide, but not sure really.",1610916630

For that reason, I was wondering if there's an ""all around"" grinder that creates perfect grounds for any type of coffee (pour over, espresso, cold brew, etc.)

This grinder would be strictly for home use. I make 3-4 cups of coffee in the morning every day and some days (sometimes I don't do this for a couple weeks) I grind quite a bit for a weekly cold brew batch (maybe 8-12 cups or more). I was looking at the HG-1 simply because it fits into my price range of under $1000, but my range isn't fixed and I'd easily pay double if there's another grinder out there that does it all and won't give me any hassle for many years. I read from one poster that, while the HG-1 is very well made and looks beautiful, it eventually got old for him to manually grind. I do also share this fear. I'm also not sure whether I should be going conical vs. flat. Based on my research, everyone seems to have their own opinion on the matter.

Coffee,Acavia8,kz9hdt,Matching grind size to brew time,"The James Hoffmann video about immersion vs percolation made me rethink grind size.  I re-read a Specialty Coffee Association 2010 presentation, with much of it discussing matching grind size with brew time  - see one of the summary slides attached.   


Since getting a new grinder last May, I have always started with its filter setting at 5, 500 microns and often gone finer.  A 5 grind looks close to powder and when I have gone to 4 and into 3s, it is probably close to espresso.  I mostly brew Ethiopian coffee. Most Ethiopian coffees in a V60 at a 5 grind, finish around 3:30 with about a 35 second bloom.  Subtracting the bloom, it is brewing around 3:00 minutes, which would indicate over extraction based on that SCA chart as they find optimal brew time for 500 microns under 2 minutes. Based on experience with my grind, I assumed a 6 grind, 600 microns, would likely hit closer to its place on that chart.    


Today I ground a coffee, that I had been doing at a 5, on a 6.  It finished at 3:06 with a 35 second bloom.  So it probably did brew as long as it should to hit that graph. It was very good.  The resulting coffee was already very good at a 5 grind, and was consistent from brew to brew.  At a 6 it was noticeably more smooth and tasted more complete/richer. Its brightness was about the same - it did not get more acidic.  Tomorrow I will try a 5.75 which should hit closer to a point on the graph.

Coffee,yelppely1122,kz8105,Pour Overs and Blends,"In recent years I‚Äôve gotten a bit more particular about my daily cup of coffee. But unlike something like beer or wine, I‚Äôm pretty hesitant to try something new at home. First, buying a bag of new beans requires me to consider adjusting ratio, brew time, and grind size to achieve my preferred cup. Plus, it‚Äôs possible I just won‚Äôt care for the coffee as much as my go-to* and will be locked into coffee that leaves me a bit unsatisfied for a couple of weeks while I finish the bag. So... at home, I‚Äôm pretty dialed in. 

But... when I go out, I can‚Äôt wait to try something new. I love getting pour overs around town or when visiting new places. Generally, I‚Äôm looking for lower acidity, milk chocolate, toffee... those sorts of flavors. For whatever reason, after reading coffee descriptions, I frequently land on a blend. Often, if I ask the barista for a blend pour over they will try to steer me towards a single origin roast instead. I‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúdrink what you like‚Äù so I don‚Äôt sweat it too much. But... is there some reason that I shouldn‚Äôt be using blends for pour overs? I understand the interest in tasting a single origin ‚Äî and I‚Äôm happy to try one when the flavors line up. But, also, I get kind of excited to see what different rosters come up with for their blends. In some ways that seems to be a better way to experience a new shop since the roaster has taken more variables into their own hands. 

Anyway, is there another perspective out there? Should I consider focusing on single origins for pour overs when I‚Äôm at a new place? Just trying to understand why baristas seem to hesitate when I choose a blend.

Coffee,hope_still_flies,lpqjpn,Moka pot questions,"Just got a moka pot (cheap off brand version) and I have some questions. My daily driver is pour over with Kalitta 185, but was occasionally making some faux espresso with the Aeropress. Recently picked up a moka pot to try out making some faux espresso with that since I was a little tired of the labor intensive Aeropress method I had adopted. Tried it out for the first time and was more or less pleased with the outcome considering it was the first try and I hadn't really tried being precise with anything.

I am curious about a couple things though. First, the capacity/ratio. I got what was labeled as a 6 cup. I could only fit about 20 grams of grounds in the chamber (fine espresso grind), and filling to the valve was about 250 ml of water. I didn't measure what the output was, but I'd say maybe there was still maybe a third of the water left at the bottom in the end. I was making for two and I'd guess maybe 75-100 in each cup once poured. So output volume was ok for two (which is what I was expecting from the 6 cup based on my research), but I was surprised at the limited input of coffee. 20 grams to 250ml water, or even the 200ml end result is not very concentrated and overall not much in terms of how much coffee is in the end brew when split between two people (theoretically 10 grams coffee per each). I have to admit I was also surprised that the end result was still rather tasty and when milk was added it was still good, so I guess I should just trust the moka pot and be thankful to be using less coffee (I was using 20 gram to 50ml water for a faux espresso in the Aeropress). But I was wondering what others experiences were in regards to how much grounds you are getting in and/or what overall ratio you end up with.

Second question is how do ya'll fill the grounds chamber without making a huge mess? Any tips?",1614007140

Coffee,muskogeee,lppf9w,Is espresso from a pressurized portafilter better than no espresso? Any recommendations for a machine to pair with Encore?,"So I've seen dozens of YouTube videos and posts on here where coffee aficionado's scoff at the idea of a pressurized portafilter and go on and on in detail about why it's not real espresso and can never be as good, but I haven't seen this question posed before:

Is it still better than having no espresso machine at all?

Does it get you something between like a moka pot and real espresso?   
Is it good enough for sweetened/milk drinks that hide less-than-perfect extraction?

Keep in mind I'm not talking about really cheap $40 WalMart espresso machines here, but higher quality models with pressurized portafilters, or even those that support both regular and pressurized.

If decent results are achievable, can anyone recommend a machine with a pressurized portafilter that pairs well with the Baratza Encore?  Maybe one that supports regular portafilters as well in case I ever graduate to a better grinder that can do proper espresso. 

As for price I'm thinking around the $500 mark but maybe a little higher if needs be.

I got into bean juice making ~6-7 months ago, as we all got stuck inside! Anyhow, I not being too sure how it‚Äôll turn out started with a Delonghi Dedica &amp;amp;amp; a JX-pro, bottomless porta filter and a unpressurized basket to go. We (my wife &amp;amp;amp; I) exclusively drink milk based drinks only, and so I make around 2-4 cups a day. Recently I got fed up of hand grinding and decided to get a Eureka Mignon Manualle and couldn‚Äôt be happier. 

As you all know how the rabbit hole goes, I‚Äôm thinking the better grinder probably deserves a better machine too. The most common starter machines you see are the Silvia And the gaggia. I did some quick review watching from expert bean juicers, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fancy man‚Äù Hoffman and other friends. The Silvia v6 looks like the winner.

My questions are:

-How much of an improvement am I actually going to see with this upgrade, over my Dedica? Is it going to be worth it (or noticeable?) 

-I understand I might need a PID mod. I‚Äôm fine doing it down the road, but might use it stock first 2-3 months. Don‚Äôt wanna go Insta-poor.

-How tough is temperature surfing going to be? I‚Äôm coming from a Dedica so I probably have crappy temps already though.

-I really like the idea of the heat exchanger machines, like the rocket apartmento, but they are too expensive. I think that‚Äôs for a few years down the road.

-How bad is the workflow to make 2-3 lattes back to back? Right now I already do shot/steam/shot/steam on the Dedica by steam mode and then purging water to cool it down, but it‚Äôs a thermoblock. Is the wait time much longer on the Silvia?

-I‚Äôm also used to being up and running within 2-3 mins. How long is typical startup time for Silvia? I‚Äôm seeing ranges from 10-40 mins =/

Coffee,welluhno,lp82e3,[Question] Should I simply ignore extraction time?,"So I'm relatively new to getting into home espresso and still mastering 'dialing in'.  I recently saw a post/gif of someone doing a really long extraction and it blew my mind. Why does everyone always recommend 27-30 second extractions as the norm?

So suddenly, I'm like, why is time even important to aim for? If time is simply the length of time water is in contact with the bean, then isn't that a linear inverse relationship to the amount of yield in the cup? Slower flow rate = smaller yield, faster flow rate = larger yield?

So, if I keep my dose the same, grind size the same, and start my extraction with view to simply go until I have a desired yield based on taste, irrespective of the time it'll take - am I going to get a controllable outcome? Or am I missing something?

Ie - if I control for yield, and adjust grind size to vary the flow rate to get to that yield",1613945681

The grinders I've been reading and watched reviews on are:
Comandante C40: Seems like a favorite for most people

1zpresso:
A lot of people here recommend Jx Pro it for its quality and price. But I like K-plus the magnetic catcher and that you can exchange grinder steps on top. Design-wise I would prefer it if it looked more like the JPpro model.

Timemore:
I just found the Chestnut X. I like it design-wise and specs looks good. But I haven't found any reviews on this one (except some Asian YT videos). Has anyone here tried it and compared it to the other ones?
I'm also big fan of Chestnut G1 design, but not sure about how it compares to the rest. 

Price for the Comandante here in Norway is about 305 usd from Norwegian web store.
Price for the 1zpresso is according to the web prices I've seen at 1zpresso's website + vat (25% here and an amount the shipper takes when it arrives, usually around 24 usd).

Please help me decide üòÖ is it worth paying almost the double for comandante c40/kplus than Jx Pro? Is the Chestnut G1 even in the same league as the other ones? Should I wait for more reviews of the Chestnut X?",1613943912

Currently  I have a Porlex JP30 that I got to ‚Äúdip my toe‚Äù in hand grinding at the start or quarentine. It was great to start with and learn, but it‚Äôs slow and produces a lot of fines. I've gotten some great cups but I also get lots of muddy cups with lots of fines at the same setting. I also find it frustrating that it‚Äôs hard to tell where you are at in terms of grind level with no numbers/labels/easy to find ‚Äú0‚Äù spot on  the grinder.

I am currently looking at:

JX-Pro from 1zpresso.

M47 Phoenix.

Comandante mk3.

JX-Pro looks like a great grinder for the price, but I can‚Äôt find much info on it. I like the look, reviews say it is fast, and the dial looks easy to read to jump between grind sizes. I saw some critics say that it is just okay for pourovers as there are a lot of fines. 

M47 looks nice and I love that it is (near) step less with an easy to  read dial. It is, however, mostly plastic with pretty big price jumps for metal. I would be willing to make the jump though.

Commandante looks the best IMO. I have heard the best things about it, but it looks a pain to adjust the grind level as you cannot see what you level is. 

Anyone have any input on the three/have first hand comparisons between them?",1613937426
Coffee,scottrfrancis,lp4n8q,Slowing my pour,"After reading and watching Coffee Chronicler, I tried the ‚Äòosmotic flow‚Äô method with my v60 and was very pleased!  But, I‚Äôm having trouble slowing my pour rate enough to get a brew time of even 3 minutes.  Tastes good, so this is more an interest in experimentation.  

Currently using coffee gator gooseneck kettle - heated on gas burner. Even following the chronicler‚Äôs excellent technique tips, I just can seem to slow down the rate enough with getting a sputtery stream...

Any thoughts or tips?

Coffee,ssam_c_u_later,lp1uxr,Mouth feel?,"So yesterday my first bag of coffee from Huck came in the mail. Its a light roast, do√±a lucinda for those interested. Its very good, got the hint of green apple when the cup was cooler and was a very well balanced cup brewed in a v60. But thats besides the point. But is it normal for it to leave your mouth feeling very dry? Is that just from the higher acidity of the coffee?

Coffee,cgibsong002,lp0zkx,Chemex workflow?,"Seems like a dumb question, but I'm really not enjoying brewing with the chemex too much compared to the v60 due to not having the removable decanter. Maybe someone has a better workflow?

Basically what I'm doing is rinsing the filter in the chemex. But the pour spout is so small it either takes me ages to pour the water back out, or i need to remove the filter to do so, which is also a pain to then resituate it. 

Then after brewing is the same issue. Pour spout isn't really useful with the filter in there so i need to go to the sink to pull the filter then back to pouring the cups. 

Anyone do things differently?

Also I'm using a reusable filter currently but it seems to be the same regardless",1613925987
Coffee,LC_DMV,lp0h1v,Made my first v60,"I‚Äôve gotten into coffee the last couple of months and have explored a few different coffee techniques. I started my journey with a French press. Then an aeropress. I then went on to try the bodum pour over which I just didn‚Äôt like. Due to my dislike for the pour over, I went to the clever dripper with fond memories of my previous immersion brews. Over that time I went from pre ground coffee. To fresh beans using a blade grinder. Then a timemore c2. Which I eventually upgraded to my current 1zpresso JX Pro. Well over the weekend I decided to give pour over another try but with a v60. Today I made my first cup out of the v60. It is so beautiful. The subtle flavors and pleasant bitterness of the coffee that were blunted by the clever dripper and masked by the sweetness and earthiness of immersion brewing now come to the front of the cup. This is, despite being my first v60 brew, my favorite cup of coffee to date. I‚Äôll still go back to my immersion brewers (wether my aeropress or clever dripper) from time to time. But I don‚Äôt see anything becoming my daily driver ahead of the v60.",1613924568
Coffee,s2alexan,lozd01,Is there a pour over cone that is sized for 4-6 cup paper basket coffee filters?,"Sometimes I want to make more coffee than I can fit in my v60 but I still really like doing a manual pour over and don't want a drip machine. But I can't find any kind of holder for 4-6 cup flat bottom basket coffee filters (a very common type for auto drip machines). I feel like something like this should exist but I can't find anything. I suppose I could buy a drip machine and then throw out everything but the plastic basket filter holder but that seems wasteful. And it would be ugly. I'm also considering asking an etsy seller who makes ceramic pour over cones to make me a custom one. Is there anyone else who wants to make larger pour overs than fit in the single cup filters? What do you use?

I have a chemex but it has the same problem as the v60, bed depth of the grounds is too high and I have to grind coarser and I don't get as good extraction as my v60. I feel the larger flat bottom shape is ideal for larger volumes.",1613921462

Coffee,Lukaszeq,lov6w1,[USER REVIEWS] Is there Fragrantica but for coffee?,"I know there are sites like coffeereview.com or countless blogs around the web, but for me they are missing a very crucial ingredient - aggregatable user input. 

First thing that comes into my mind is a portal similar in form to Fragrantica, where people could easily share their opinions.

Coffee (as well as perfumes) is extremely subjective in experiencing. The view of a product (coffee) being subjugated to reviewer's bias is an excluding factor. 
However, if I read few reviews more I would be more interested in digging deeper. Especially, if a community flourish around the imagined site I would be able to follow users with whom I share similar taste.

What do you think? Would ""Cafentica"" work?
Or maybe there is something like that which I am not aware of?

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody seems to agree that flat burrs are better than conical burrs. So, why almost all high-end manual grinders (Comandante, Kinu, 1zpresso,...) have conical 47mm burrs? Should I expect that any electrical flat-burrs grinder is better?

Coffee,WoweeBlowee,lonvtx,Why Your K-Cup Coffee Might Sort of Suck,"Hey, /r/coffee. I've been an avid coffee drinker for years now, and have incrementally gotten into more and more intense methods of brewing and eventually even home roasting. I've got half a kitchen worth of coffee equipment, and I even work-- admittedly only tangentially-- in the industry. But it all started when my aunt gave me a Keurig brewer as a going-to-college present nearly a decade ago, and so maybe I've got maybe a kind of soft spot in my heart for these things. I know that Keurig and Keurig-like appliances, as a brew method, have *plenty* of problems to delve into-- temperature, brew time, poor quality beans, actual waste, you name it. But I wanted to cover something far more glaring that I've noticed only recently, on-the-job: **K-Cups Have Like Holy Shit No Coffee In Them, Or At Least Way Less Than The Average End User Expects/Needs**

OK, so: The SCA recommends 55g of coffee per 1000g of water. Your average ""coffee mug"" type coffee cup holds something like \~350g of water/coffee/liquid. Based on the SCA ratio, this means that you need 19.25g of coffee for a typical coffee cup. With this in mind, a cursory glance at K-Cup pods on store shelves or even on Keurig's own website is pretty hair-raising: These K-Cups have around 13-14g of coffee in them, on the *very high* side, more like an average of 12g, and as little as 9g. ***Nine grams.*** I've seen 36-count bulk boxes of these things selling for nearly $30 with a net weight of something like 15oz, when that same amount of that same coffee would sell for half that price if it was in a Good Old Bag‚Ñ¢. Meanwhile, these brewers have default settings in the 8-10oz range, so that they'll brew to fill a-- you guessed it-- standard American coffee cup.

The point here is that, even if you're not super pretentious about your coffee, if you regularly use a Keurig brewer and you're using one coffee pod to brew something like 8-10oz of water, then your coffee is coming out massively underextracted; it's quite literally ""watered down."" It seems that the average K-cup is best portioned for about 6oz of water, and if you adjust your brewer accordingly, you may notice a distinct difference in flavor.",1613877944

Coffee,tentenmami,krgdhq,Making the switch from using creamer to drinking coffee black. Possible?,"I'm am avid coffee drinker. I drink a cup a day, sometimes more, but have always needed it with a creamer. For me it's the taste of the coffee mixed the creamer (hazelnut preferably) that has me hooked to it. I've counted my calories for a while and have always wanted that extra wiggle room I'd have if I could eliminate the creamer. Has anyone done so successfully? Would switching to plain milk without the sugar be a place to start? Granted it would be difficult, as I need the sweetness but there are those that drink coffee with milk without any sweetener so? It seems like an impossible task to me right now, and I refuse to cut coffee altogether. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!

Coffee,Gerard_Iero,krfipw,"Confession time, I can't taste a difference between blade and burr ground coffee. What am I doing wrong?","I suppose little context is in order, I'm new to the coffee game and have been using some cheap manual burr coffee grinder. I don't honestly know what brand. For Christmas I got an electric blade grinder, I did ask specifically for burr but mistakes happen and it was a gift so I'm not too upset about it. I decided to take this thing for a spin and made a few cups with both it and the other grinder. I am slightly ashamed to say that I cant taste any discernable difference. Now maybe if I had them side by side I could, but as of the moment I cannot. It is entirely possible that the burr grinder I was using is also low quality  which may be a contributing factor. There could also be something wrong with my technique, though I am fairly confident I am doing all the right steps (I brew in a moka pot which is pretty straight forward). My ability to discern the nuances of different types of coffee might just not be as developed as it needs to be. Everyone insists that burr ground coffee is a night and day difference compared to pre ground or blade ground, but I just haven't been able to tell.  Any tips on what I might be missing?",1609904663

Coffee,imkylebell,krc5vh,Good coffee from a vintage siphon pot,"Maybe two or three years ago after returning from Japan, I decided I wanted to try replicating the siphon coffee that we were served for our first breakfast. I some research and found out that they used to be very common in the US before auto-percolators took off in the 1960s. I then bought a Nicro Model 500 off Craigslist with the metal filter, figuring it would be less prone to breakage than glass and easier to clean than a cloth filter.

The problem is, I could never make good coffee. The water wouldn't heat up to the suggested 205 degrees and it would clog instead of draining. 

Then, this past week, I tried it again and it made excellent coffee. It was complex, deep, clean, and even warmer at first sip than a pour-over. I used:

* a light generic breakfast roast
* a 17.5:1 ratio
* a grind size similar to pre-ground drip coffee
* 900g of water, enough for three mugs of coffee
* no temperature measurement, only turning down stove and waiting for water to stop bubbling in the upper chamber
* coffee steeping for around a minute, then turned off gas and let coffee drain

Full brew time was somewhere from 5-7 minutes. 

I started thinking how I might have lucked into such a good cup and I realized that a big batch, high ratio, drip grind generic coffee, and no temp control is probably how the device was meant to be used in a 1950s kitchen or diner, where there wouldn't have been fancy grinders, temp probes, or even time to fuss over the coffee like I would with a manual pour-over.

Fresh off a few great cups, I tried brewing an Ethiopian light roast and it went right back to clogging from all the fines. I guess to use this siphon, I have to keep my coffee styles from the 1950s as well.",1609893688

I can hear the small bubbles pop if I put the cup to my ear. When I pour the milk to my moka coffee, the foam just floats right on top instead of mixing.

On youtube I've seen some pretty decent latte art with just a french press. Is there a technique to this? Am I doing this wrong?

Here's what I do:
1. Microwave milk in press to 65C
2.  3 big pumps with the press pulling out of the surface of milk
3. Continuous quick presses while keeping the press within the liquid. Periodic swirls
4. A minute of this then take the top off, swirl out bubbles

Coffee,brono_trigger,kr8bal,Do you wash your coffee pot/carafe with soap and water?,"I was at my mom's for the holidays and as I was about to wash the coffee pot with soap and water, as one does, she exclaimed in horror ""No! Never wash it with soap, just rinse it with hot water!"". When I asked her why, she couldn't give me a reason other than that's what she was always told.  So I gave her a suspicious side-eye, but begrudgingly went along with it and drank coffee out of a pot with brown stains all around the insides of it, because she's at the age where you can't tell her what she's always known is wrong.  

It's not the first time I've had someone tell me they don't use soap on their coffee pots... back when I was too young too know better than to drink the office coffee, a co-worker also told me they don't use soap because it leaves residue that affects the flavor of the coffee.  I was suspicious then as well, since if he believed hot water was hot enough to get rid of the residual coffee oils (which it's not) why wouldn't it also be able to get rid of the soap residue?  He also told me his theory applied to wine glasses as well and I almost fainted.  

I feel like this is a myth that needs to die.  Coffee flavors come from the oil in the beans right? Oil exposed to air goes rancid over time.  Oil and water don't mix, so hot water is not enough to completely get rid of residual coffee oils (otherwise we wouldn't need soap to clean greasy pans!).  Rancid oil residues in your fresh pot of coffee will make it taste not as good as it should, thus the logical conclusion would be that if you really don't want the flavor of your coffee being affected by any foreign substances, you need to wash you coffee pots (and filter baskets) with soap and water.

With that said, I do agree that some brands of dish soap (like Palmolive and Dawn, and pretty much any dishwasher detergent) don't rinse clean unless you rinse them very very well, which I didn't realize until I started wondering why my glass of water always had a thin layer of bubbles at the top (hint, they weren't air bubbles).  But I've found that using a soap made with more ""natural"" ingredients (like Mrs Meyers or Trader Joes) rinses away very quickly and leaves no discernible residue.

I think I may have just answered my own question, but still wondering what others' thoughts are on soap in your coffee pot.  I get taking the hot water rinsing shortcut a few days in a row, and I definitely have been guilty of it, but I don't understand being adamant about NEVER using soap for fear it's going to run your coffee.",1609882197

I am looking for recommendations for a “single cup” auto drip brewer to replace my trusty, albeit lackluster Hamilton Beach Scoop. “Single cup” is in quotes because many in that category are just a touch too small.

My concerns and needs are these:

1) I am the only coffee drinker in the house and generally have one 14-16 ounce coffee each morning. Rarely a second. Also, the battle for counter space is real in my house. It needs to be small.

2) I hate cleanup. Fewer parts is better. Brewing directly into the mug is best! I was eyeballing the Bonavita, but the basket-on-carafe design means using and cleaning the carafe every time. No thanks.

3) This will not replace my Aeropress, French press, etc. I will spend the time when I have it, but most days I need the coffee to take care of itself while I spend time feeding my two preschool-aged kids.

4) I have begun roasting my own as a hobby, but I rarely have time for cupping. Having an auto drip that lets me taste my coffee the best it can be in my daily cup is very helpful.

Coffee,tauhammerhead,kr7nae,Aeropress v Stovetop,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 people’s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought I’d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: I’m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isn’t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear people’s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609880337

So today I went into our local Cafe and decided to try a new pour over Guatemala roast. I was able to see what their barista was doing, and everything seemed normal until the end. After pouring she waited until the cone drained maybe half way, then pinched the top together and kind of moved the filter in a circle around the cone. In my experience with pour over you simply wait for your filter to drain and throw it away. The way I see it is you're applying pressure, AND squeezing those last few drops from the grounds, which just sounds like a recipe for bitter over extracted coffee. It's not like it was bad or anything, but I like getting the max potential out of my beans. What do y'all think? Ever apply pressure at the end of your brew? Why? Why not? How did it taste?

- put the Moka on the corner of the coils, so the base has the most coverage.

- As soon as I notice the water start to make some pre-boiling noise, I cut the heat from max -&gt; ""5"" (medium).

- once the coffee starts to erupt I kill the heat entirely, letting the residual heat take it to completion.


As the heat output of these electric ranges take some time to adjust to the setting, I've found this to be a good balance between speed / quality / simplicity

If the coffee eruption starts and heat is too high I've found that it bubbles quickly, and the flow is interrupted prematurely, leading to incomplete extraction.  I started to time things, but if you pay attention you can hear the water talking to you, telling you it is close. :)

Protip: If you miss it and the coffee is flowing quickly, you can lift the Moka pot above the element, this will decrease heat very quickly.

Lastly I don't think there is a more satisfying moment than the noise she makes just as she's about to erupt, hearing it grow and build until it slowly trickles down.  😎",1609872825

Seems like less cleanup necessary than with a FP and I can use common kitchen items rather than have a unitasker device like the FP?

The only difference I'm thinking is that glass isn't great for retaining heat so would need to something else in the kitchen and the strainer might not be as fine as a FP. But I'm fine with these two drawbacks of you guys think my assumption is correct.",1609855961

Coffee,SomebodyInACity,kqxk9g,I never knew that a grinder upgrade would make such a dramatic impact!,"Hello hello!

Reminder that having good tools helps a ton. I recently upgraded to a commandante c40, coming from a hario slim, and holy moly was it worth it. Along with that I got a pouring kettle, and that's been great cuz I like preboiling my water before i put it in my bialetti. I'll do a before and after coffee routine so you can have a good laugh at how ridiculously complex things used to be.

Before, to get a mediocre cup of moka, I had to:  
1. Guesstimate the amount of coffee beans, put it in grinder  
2. spend 20 minutes grinding, with the grinder frequently jamming  
3. sift the grounds into a big bowl  
4. grind the left over giant grinds through again  
5. sift that once more, throw away whats left  
6. spread out grounds on paper towel, massage it around to catch the fines  
7. collect grounds in a smaller bowl, throw away the paper towel  
8. Spoon coffee into bialetti basket carefully  
9. put bowl with water into a microwave to boil it, put hotplate on induction hob  
10. spoon boiled water from boil into base, put in coffee basket, screw on the top.  
11. finally place moka pot on hotplate and let it do its thing  
12. cool down base before the fountain starts sputtering and FINALLY get to drink coffee

And even then with all that effort, all I got was a ton of unbalanced extraction. I couldn't get rid of this ""battery acid"" taste that seemed to get into everything i did, and changing grind size on the hario slim never did anything to mitigate it.  
Now, it's so simple, it's laughable.  
1. Weigh out coffee beans on scale  
2. grind in under a minute  
3. flip the grounds into the basket, the commandante jars fit the basket perfectly  
4. Boil water in kettle, heat up induction hotplate  
5. put boiling water in moka, put in coffee basket, screw on the top  
6. moka on hotplate, let it do it's thing  
7. cool down base before fountain starts sputtering and have coffee!

I haven't dialled things in exactly, but the difference in grind quality means that the resulting coffee i've been getting is so much less muddy. A good grinder really goes a long way. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to notice anything, but even just in smell the difference was clear as day. The battery acid taste, gone. The siltiness of the coffee was a lot less, there wasn't as much sand that came up. Thank you guys for guiding me into getting a better grinder, it's brought me a LOT of joy and confidence to keep experimenting.",1609849747

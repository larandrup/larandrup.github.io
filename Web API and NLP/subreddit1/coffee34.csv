Coffee,hamiltonient,kqkqm3,Pour over taking a long time,"Hi all,

A bit of background here:

\-Hario V60 dripper w/ brown hario tabbed filters

\-Baratza Encore (set to approx 16 on their scale)

\-Fellow Stagg EKG kettle

\-coffee set to 1:18 ratio approximately (18g coffee/240ml water)

I use a slow pour, filling only to the top of the grinds. I then allow for a (mostly) full drain before repouring. I need somewhere around 8 pours to complete my extraction. It seems to be taking around  7 minutes total to brew, including 30-45 seconds or so for bloom.

5-6 minutes seems like a long time for the actual extraction. What could I be doing wrong here? The only things I can think of are possibly the coarseness of my grounds, or the filter themselves. Any other thoughts?

Thanks in advance!",1609802355

Coffee,PartyAtTheMoon-Tower,kqja2v,Having a strange phenomenon happening when I drink coffee out of a thermal vs. carafe. Would appreciate some insight!,"Okay, so last time I asked this I was downvoted to hell, but this seems to be a real phenomenon and I need to know if this is happening to anyone else. Basically: my coffee has been tasting great coming out of my thermals, but tastes like watery/ papery crud when drank at home. 

For example: I was working through this bag of Yellow Honey process from Boy and the Bear Coffee. My first two cups, drank at home, were really cruddy. Exactly as described above. Now, I've been out almost every day since Christmas, and since then that coffee has tasted so good. I get every note on the bag... just this bright, acidic/sweet passion fruit. I figured the small changes I made to my brew fixed the coffee.

Well, had a cup today, first time home in a few weeks... prepared it normally... and back to that watery/ papery/ dry taste. I was floored. 

The ONLY factor that changed was the thermal. Not only that, but I JUST got a new thermal. I had this issue with an old metal one, and thought the metal was doing weird things, but now I have a Frank Green ceramic lined thermal from Onyx. Which is supposed to keep the flavor of your coffee.

So I'm just so confused, but also feel somewhat hopeless. I thought my brews were starting to get consistent... I've had great cups of multiple coffees over the past few weeks... and suddenly they are tasting like crap at home.

Which makes me wonder if I was really tasting my coffee at all, and just making crappy brews the whole time. But... how is that possible? I know what I taste, and these have had very clear profiles. I've had some great cups.

Does anyone have any theories as to what could be happening? Why does keeping my coffee in a ceramic thermal for an hour seem to make this kind of difference?",1609798104

Coffee,Gaspuch62,kqiysp,"American coffee lovers, have you started using Metric measurements more because of coffee?","I've always been aware of metric and used metric measurements from time to time, but when the world around you uses imperial, you think in imperial.

When I got into coffee, though, I found that most guides used metric units. It wasn't an issue for me as I just switched the units my kitchen scale used and started using grams for everything coffee and favoring weight over volume. 

I still use imperial measurements for most things, but when I'm in the kitchen, I start thinking in terms of liters, grams, and Celsius. This thinking is even bleeding into other parts of my kitchen routines. Instead of measuring powders in teaspoons and tablespoons, I use grams. Instead of making 16 ounces of coffee, I make half a liter of coffee.

Voice assistants and coffee calculator apps have been pretty helpful with this too as I'll often be looking at common imperial measurements and converting them to metric (or the nearest neat number). I can commonly be heard saying things like, ""Hey google, how many grams is eight ounces?"" or ""Hey google, how many grams is a cup of broccoli?""

Coffee,wwm824,kqfgto,New Grinder is producing fines,"So I bought a Millwright hand grinder from SAI.  Out of the box, I was super impressed, and for my first couple of grinds, it produced consistent grinds.  I went from a finer pourover grind to a medium coarseness for a french press and I noticed there were some fines caked on the side.  Cup was super muddy but I kept the same coarseness when I went to grind for a drip later, and it still produced some fines.  The majority of the grind was medium coarse though, just to note.  So I made sure I was enough clicks out, and went down to the first click to then count my clicks again (but first I ground some coffee at the first click; idk why I did, I guess just to test out if it could go fine enough for espresso).  So I then went back to the same grind for my drip.  I ground just a few beans just to test and it looked good, but then when I dosed it for a full cup, it produced a ton of fines again.  Will this go away after a few grinds?  Are those fines just the fines that were left over from the previous grind and will they eventually be expelled?  Am I grinding too fast or aggressively (if that’s a thing)?  This grinder seems quite well built, I find it hard to believe this is just a bad grinder.",1609787422

Same beans, same grind setting. I work my way down to 20 and it pulls maybe 15-20 grams, bump it up to 21, pulls 28-30 grams.

So I’m a coffee novice, and I got a 2-in-1 blade-grinder and brewer machine for Christmas. I also have different types of beans. I want to start learning how to “taste” different tastes of coffee (I’m learning from James Hoffman), but I need to have two diff. cups of coffee in front of me with two diff. flavors. But in order to prepare both of those, I’d need to:

1. Prepare the beans, coffee filter, and water in the machine
2. Wait for the beans to grind by letting the blade grinder do its thing (2 minutes)
3. Wait 40 minutes for the ground coffee beans to brew
4. Clean the machine (2-3 minutes) to prepare for the next batch of diff. flavor (diff. type of beans)
5. Repeat steps 1-3 to prepare the second batch of coffee, by which time the original batch will have gone cold... by which point I will need to microwave the original batch just so it’s the same temperature as the second batch

Coffee,WingedBeing,kqby1r,Please critique the fuck out of my French press technique,"I thought I had this, and for a while I believe that I did even though I was technically doing everything wrong. Let me first start off by saying that the measurements within my French press are unequivocally wrong. The max line, which is marked as 8 cups? Yeah, that's actually 4. I only realized this a month after getting it, so I was dumping four cups of water onto what was essentially 16 tbs of medium ground coffee (yes, I know, we're getting to that). What I was getting was actually very strong coffee, no doubt due to the sheer quantity of coffee involved.

I recently came into the possession of a coffee grinder, so I said ""look out world, here comes some regulation French press coffee."" First, I realized that I had not eight, but four cups of water to deal with. So I calculated 8 tbs of coarse ground coffee. Here's how I do this:

1. Heat water to boiling in a sauce pan.

2. Measure 8 tbs of freshly ground coffee (coarse) and put in press.

3. After water is boiling, I take it off heat and let sit for 30 seconds.

4. I dump all of the water into the press and stir.

5. I put the lid on for four minutes, then press. Coffee is served.

Problem is, what I'm getting now is very weak. Yes, I should expect it to be weaker than when there were 16 tbs of finely ground coffee for 4 cups of water, but man...that actually tasted great! This tastes watery and thin.

What am I doing wrong here? Is it how I'm adding the water? Do I actually need a scale to measure in grams as I'm reading some people do? Is it as simple as just using more coffee?",1609777332

Admittedly, this was my first time using Dezcal, and I poured the powder directly into a kettle full of water (as opposed to mixing a solution first and pouring that into the kettle).

The result was kind of strange...a good amount of scale spots are still present, and now there are dark splotches on the bottom of my kettle visible in the center and on the left on the picture.  

Did I screw up in not mixing the solution, and did I damage the kettle?  Is there a way to get it back to ""normal""?

Coffee,apprximatelycorrect,kpyh31,How to improve pour over results at this point?,"Here's what I'm currently doing: I usually am grinding beans from Heart Roasters (currently an Ethiopian) with the following recipe: 

15g beans (ground to 5M on the Baratza Forte BG)

my recipe (v60) is:

* preheat/wet with hot tap water (typically I go to a full boil, 212 F on the Fellow EKG) 
* **0:00-0:45** \- 45g water in and a slight swirl to ensure infusion
* **0:45-1:15** \- additional 105g water in (150g total)
* **1:15-1:45** \- additional 100g water in (250g total), slightly swirl to knock attached grounds. 

I'm just wondering what is my ""next step"" in improving my pour over technique/results? I get decent results usually (maybe a little less fruity than I want sometimes, so I do tend to grind on occasion slightly finer to maybe around 5D). The other variable I haven't played with is water -- I am using city water -- but I don't know how much of a difference it makes + I would want some kind of sustainable way to modify my water source. 

I'm just eager to learn more about coffee and seek to get the most out as I can, so any suggestions as to what I can do to improve are welcome!",1609725358

Coffee,HighOfTheTiger,kpvvod,Hoping for some advice on where to start!,"So to start I drink almost exclusively iced coffee. For the longest I’ve just brewed Foldgers medium in a cheap coffee pot and poured it over ice. My wife is obsessed with the Starbucks Peppermint Mocha grinds we get (she drinks it hot).

I’ve got a cheap French press from IKEA that I use for cold brew sometimes, but I still prefer hot coffee poured over ice.

I want to get into some higher quality coffee. Considering we have it twice a day we may as well enjoy it as much as possible. I’ve browsed around and seen some things about hand grinding, and different methods of brewing and was hoping to get a little input on a couple things.

I love the in-depth, sweet tones that come from cold brewing coffee, so I’m looking for a way to brew it that tones down the bitterness and really brings out the flavor, while still brewing hot so I’m not making separate types of coffee for the two of us.

I don’t mind the manual, more involved aspect of it, so I’d rather go with quality over convenience of use if that makes sense. I’d rather go with higher quality equipment and beans rather than entry level and go up from there.

As far as the coffee itself goes, it may be an oxymoron, but I’m looking for something that is a light-medium roast, that has that sweeter mocha flavor to it. Are there good online retailers for this, or is it better to find a local place to get it from?

Appreciate any help and input, thanks!",1609716800

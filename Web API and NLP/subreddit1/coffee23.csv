Coffee,polygonfuture,l137sm,Coava Kilenso + Moka Pot = acidic at first. Bitter at end. Heeelp,"Hi wonderful r/Coffee community.

I am using a Bialetti Moka pot for the first time ever.  I've made a few batches but not quite getting a good flavor.  I'm in need of some advice.

These are the details of my setup:

&amp;#x200B;

* 3 Cup Moka Pot
* Coava Kilenso in espresso roast
* \~Somewhere between 24-27 grams of coffee in basket
* No tamping / just leveling by tapping sides

&amp;#x200B;

My process:

1. Grind somewhere between 24-27 grams of coffee. Consistency is courser than table salt.  Maybe double the size (0.6mm - 1mm in size?)
2. Pre-boil water in kettle and fill below safety valve.
3. Place grounds basket in, screw together and place on medium low heat.
4. Takes maybe a minute or two before coffee starts coming out of top.
5. When coffee starts to bubble pull it off and run under cold water.
6. When I open the pot, the grounds are somewhat damp (not dry, not a puddle though)
7. There's maybe half an inch of water still left in the bottom of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

The result is a coffee that is murky (similar to french press).  There's a bit of acidic / sour notes at first (because of kilenso?), but it ends bitter.      


Does this sound about right?   Anyone have suggestions on how I could reduce the bitterness at the end?",1611122826

The simplicity of the design and I’ll be honest “German engineering“ appeals to me. I don’t like that it’s a blade grinder rather than burr.  I’m mainly a coffee drinker, not espresso.

My current setup is burr grinder and pour over and while it’s great for weekends, many times during weekdays, I just want to press a button and get my coffee in the morning. I’m not a fan of single pods (I’ve tried both Keurig and nespresso pods). I’m the only coffee drinker in the house so I need a single cup maker.

Coffee,solideuce,l0xklp,Tried Fresh Coffee - Feel Like I'm Missing Something...,"Recently came back to brewing fresh coffee after an absence of several years. Upgraded to a Technivorm Moccamaster after my Bonavita's life ended after a solid seven years and use a Baratza Encore for grinding.  I primarily use the MM for my daily coffee intake, but also enjoy a pour-over or Aeropress when the mood hits. All products used are descaled and cleaned properly and as recommended. 

For years, I have been consuming Jose's coffee (from Costco), mainly the French Roast , and have really enjoyed it. However, with my new MM, I wanted to get back into fresh coffee again. I've tried two different types of fresh roasted coffee from two different roasters and I feel like I'm missing something. One was a South America blend, the other was a Kenyan single origin. I've drank both black with no cream or sugar or any additives and though I have enjoyed them, I don't get the flavors or hints of flavors expected. They both are vibrant and taste great, but I don't taste much of a difference between the two. They both just taste like better black coffee than before. 

I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I went through the South American blend in about a week through a pour-over and MM and didn't notice much of a difference. I see all the posts here about the flavors tasted on fresh coffee and I just am not getting that on my end. I've got the MM and Encore dialed in for coffee:water and grind size, so I know it's not that. I doubt it's my palette too. Just looking for some tips or tricks or maybe someone can point out something that I am glaringly missing.",1611103163

I was disgusted and quickly squashed them and looked all over the Keurig for any others. After inspecting and not seeing more, I thought that was that. Today, I went to my Keurig to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and as I opened it a couple of small roaches scurried out. I’m horrified. I’ve realized that these pests are LIVING in my keurig. In all those little nooks and crannies of it. Apparently, they like the warmth and wetness of it. I didn’t think it was possible for the roaches to survive in there but apparently it’s home sweet home for them after researching this online for the past hour (why isn’t it designed to prevent this???). Anyways, I’m disgusted.

Is the keurig salvageable or should I throw it out? I loved the convenience that the Keurig provided. I would just fill up a reusable cup with some grounds, pop it into the keurig, push a button and have coffee ready in a minute. I’d really like to continue making coffee this way and I’m really not a coffee snob so I don’t mind that it’s not as good as something made from a French press or whatever other methods there are out there.

I grind my coffee with a [Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/grinders/products/ceramic-coffee-mill-skerton-plus) and, believe it or not, I found a setting that grinds just fine for the three methods. I use filtered water through a Brita filter, and for the pour-overs I use the 60 g per liter of water ratio.

Not long ago I started buying in roaster stores that roast coffee once an order is put. And it is here where I have my doubts: what should I expect from coffee beans' characteristics, such as country, height, type of roasting and others? Which characteristics ""better"" suit my brewing methods? What other things should I take into account at the time of choosing beans?

To clarify, I'm not disappointed in my brewing. I love it! Usually I buy Colombian and Nicaraguan coffees. But I'd like to know more.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JBQZPX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_H3VbGbPTYQZKN

So I bought a gooseneck kettle for Espresso with my Flair. I didn't really want to spend the $150 on the Stagg, so I went with the Miroco gooseneck kettle instead for $75. Ultimately I did end up returning it and getting a Stagg EKG, but I wanted to talk about the Miroco a bit.

Obviously, the Miroco is a knockoff of the Stagg. Extremely similar design, identical spout, same base connection mechanism.

Between the two kettles, these are the things that are the same: base connector, spout, internal heating chamber is ALMOST identical, the heating plate and thermocouple are the exact same except rotated 180° from one another, even down to the gap at the bottom.

The single thing that made me realize that these kettles are likely made in the same factory or with some of the same tooling is the switches on the back for holding temp and switching to C/F. These switches are pretty crappy, and I was a bit disappointed to see them on the Stagg because it would've been so easy to use a simple rocker switch that would feel magnitudes better, but they didn't. And the Miroco kettle has the EXACT same crappy slider switches.

Now, all that being said, the one thing in my mind that the Stagg has over the Miroco kettle is that it holds temperature much better and might tighter to the set point.  I think the Stagg is both checking the temp more frequently and is a more robust software loop. The Stagg holds within 1° F, whereas the Miroco will drop up to 3° on the readout, but the thermometer is inaccurate by up to 5°, pretty sloppy.

So with all of that being said, if you don't need a super accurate temperature control, for something like espresso, I could absolutely recommend the Miroco kettle as a much cheaper option to the Stagg.

Also, for what it's worth, the Miroco has fantastic customer support. I emailed them about the inaccurate thermometer just asking if there was a way to calibrate it, and they, unprompted, sent another one my way and a return shipment label for the first kettle.",1611070965

As the title says, I've been an espresso drinker forever. Recently I got a V60 for christmas but had to wait a bit for the friggin gooseneck kettle to get here. After a couple tries, I'm really starting to wonder that the hell is the big fuss. From what I've read and watched online, I could get different, interesting, fruity flavor profiles from my beans that could be different than when brewed as espresso. Right now all I taste is weak ""brown water"" coffee comparable to what you get at convenience stores. I mean, is that it ? is it just a glorified trendy way to hand make percolator coffee ?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my recipe/process : 

20g in yirgacheffe, about a month off roast, light roast, freshly ground to slighly coarser than espresso but  would'nt call it ""coarse"". Classic ceramic V60 with the japan made filters than comes in a box of 40.   

Shake the grounds flat, make a hole with a spoon. 30-40 ish seconds bloom with 40g of water, straight off the boil (remember I'm using a light roast)

then concentric pour up to about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes. I'm not stressing the total pour time to get to 2 minutes as I feel more heat retention and less variation must be good for a light roast. Then stir clockwise with a spoon, complete drawdown achieved in about 2:30 minutes. 

And when I taste it, I wish I'd make an espresso. I mean, there might be stuff to tweak and I have yet to try the 4:6 method, but I doubt it will ever be that better than ""office coffee"".",1611065420

I have a tricycle that I'd happily convert, but to buy a kegerator for nitro brew would cost the best part of £1,500 and the kegs don't offer much margin in the UK. (£4/Litre to buy) + cups and straws etc. But I guess nitro brew tends to sell for more than hot espresso coffees, right? So maybe I'm wrong. It's not that popular or trendy in the UK yet.
Cold brew can be prepped at home, but obviously it'll be a trial and error process, and the prep time to steep and filter the batches could eat up a lot of my time, with no need to clean the equipment because it'll all be bottled for resale.

What do you think? I'm learning towards cold brew because I can make it more personalised, but then nothing looks as cool as a nitro brew pump on a sunny day! And ultimately NBC would be way more efficient, all things considered.

However, I came across this video and it got me thinking: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CCW2ctpH6w&amp;ab\_channel=TheRealSprometheus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CCW2ctpH6w&amp;ab_channel=TheRealSprometheus)

I wanted to know people's thoughts on their favorite distribution techniques and what has worked/works for them. Also, I would like to get thoughts on this video because I know lots of people love to use the OCD tool/things like it. For people that don't feel like watching the stats are as follows:

**Tapping -**

* 18 Grams In
* 35.8 Grams Out
* 9.51 TDS = 18.91% (extraction)

**WDT/Paperclip-**

* 18 Grams In
* 36.9 Grams Out
* 8.03 TDS = 16.46%

**OCD Tool -**

* 18 Grams In
* 36.4 Grams Out
* 7.67 TDS = 15.51%

As you can see the tapping method (literally grinding into the portafilter and tapping on a table) seems to give the best extraction out of the 3 and I believe could be a culprit of my sour (under-extracted) shots. Let me know what you all think, have a great day!",1611064505
Coffee,KenoxZOOM,l0jgdg,I'm getting a new hand grinder. 1zpresso JX-PRO or JE?,"I can get **JE (Itamil burr)** around $110 plus shipping to my area or **JX-Pro (Stainless steel burr)** around $175 including shipping.

So My paradox of choice begins here since Itamil is specialized for espresso while stainless steel burr does better in pour over and I don't make espresso. I enjoy pour over, french press and aeropress.  


Does burr make much difference? Should I still go with JX-Pro?",1611061522

I really got no idea which grind setting is best or a good starting place when brewing a 250ml or 300ml cup.. I've tried so many I'm getting a bit overwhelmed and disparaged.

I have gone anywhere from the dot between FILTER and AEROPRESS all the way to the P in AEROPRESS (as per square mile website). I've watched like every video on Youtube and tried to compare with photos etc but argh there must be someone in the interwebs who can tell me what to put.

Please don't tell me 'taste is subjective, whatever you like', I just want to know a rough area I should be in and learn to like the proper the taste.

I tend to only drink really light/fruity/floral/sweet beans and use max of 15g or 18g with my brew.

Many thanks!",1611055069

However when we ground up our coffee ourselves (really fine) we get really watery coffee, doesn't taste good at all. We tried different (stronger) coffee aswell but this doesn't work either. We tried finer grinds, coarser grinds, stamping it harder/looser. We changed the amount of water the machine puts through it but nothing fixes this.  


Would this be an issue with the refillable pod? Maybe too many holes on the top which causes the water to go through too easily?",1611047909

Coffee,EATTHEMUFFINBITCH,l0fhvh,Resources for a coffee beginner.,"Hi there, 

I am a long time coffee lover however I have recently just discovered the large world that is making my own high end coffee at home. 

For Christmas I was gifted a Breville Precision Brewer, and while it is super amazing and I have been making some very excellent cups of coffee, especially going from a cheap Mr. Coffee to this, I still feel very lost on how to refine my brews and tastes. 

I have a cheap grinder, and I know having a quality grinder seems to be a common theme here, and while my budget isn’t very big I do plan on buying a nice grinder soon. 

My biggest problem is really just I have no idea what I should be aiming for in terms of how fine I should be grinding my beans as well as how much ground coffee I should be using in my brews. Any resources that you guys would be able to provide me on this subject would be very appreciated.",1611043995

Coffee,cafe_beginner,l0f6c2,"Hi, i need some advice on setting up my batch brewer.","Hi, i run a small cafe in S.Korea.

Recently I bought a used coffee machine from Grindmaster. 

 I was hoping this machine would do elaborate extraction, but I found it difficult to program elaborate extraction because it was an outdated model. 

it only provides a maximum of six pulses. so ,pulse brewing cannot be applied during the entire brew time 

i can set the time of each pulse and brewing time.

it flows 0.8oz per sec. if i set the pulse on time 10 sec it flows water 8 oz.

and if i set the pulse off time 10 sec, it stop injecting water 10 sec.

 So, the off time is added to the time I set, and it becomes the total extraction time. 

for example,  If I apply 90 seconds extraction time and six pulses to extract 2 liters, and set the on/off time of each pulse to 10 seconds, the total extraction time is about 3 minutes or so. ( Uses 125 grams of beans )

My concern is, isn't 3 minutes too short to proceed with 2 liters of extraction?   
I want to lengthen the brewing time for proper extraction, but I want to know how to do it wisely.  

I am afraid that if I shorten the water injection time and lengthen the stop time, the coffee taste will be negative. 

How about diluting after a small amount of extraction through the bypass function? 

In Korea, batch brew is not popular and it is difficult to obtain information.

 Hope you give me a lot of advice. i really need help.

 Thanks for reading , good day!",1611042514

Coffee,raflors,l0arz3,Pandan coffee,"Hi guys, yesterday I tried mixing pandan extract to my cold brew and I can say it was so refreshing and deliciously different! I made 1:1 ratio of cold brew and pandan water + 1tbsp of muscovado sugar. The aroma of the cold brew perfectly mixed with the refreshing smell of pandan leaves, it feels like you are in a tropical country sipping your coffee and watching the waves crash into the ocean. 😍

Oh btw, Pandan is a tropical plant that grows in Southeast Asia (these are available in asian groceries), it is used to give sweet, tropical and grassy-floral-ish smell to food. Usually they put it inside of the chicken before they roast it, it also makes rice smells so good and to increase appetite.",1611025730
Coffee,pydevo,l0a5hy,Exploring Coffee Options,"A bit about me: I've never made my own coffee (unless Nescafe instant coffee counts). I regularly get coffee from a local cafe and my go-to drink is an Iced Caramel Macchiato. However, it's getting too expensive and I'd also like to cut down on sugar so I'm looking at other options. I don't know if it's just placebo but iced coffee is also easier on my gut compared to anything hot so I try to stick with that. I recently tried Cafila Farms XX Espresso, and I liked it but not sure if it's best to continue for longterm.  
Other alternative seem to be to brew my own coffee and just customize how ever I want with syrups, etc. From what I understand reading through threads:

1) Since I have a &lt;$100 budget, an Espresso machine is out of the question  
2) I could make an almost espresso using a Moka Pot  
3) I could get a french press or Aeropress and brew my own coffee

I feel like the consensus is to avoid a drip machine so I'm not listing that. Also, most of what I've found is for hot coffee (what it's supposed to be). Considering I'll be making iced coffee and adding some milk and syrup to it, I'm not sure what the best option for me would be. 

It also feels a little scary diving into something I have no idea about but after reading a lot of posts here, I feel like learning to make my own coffee would definitely be worth it and go well with my morning ritual. :) I'm open to all thoughts and recommendations!",1611023659
Coffee,WhippedMale,l09zty,V60 - 4:6 Method/General pourover questions,"Hoping to get some insight from those who've tried the 4:6 method (or any other methods that worked for them). Quick bit of background (using hario v60 #2 plastic):

&amp;#x200B;

* Pourover Method: v60 4:6 ratio (#1 50ml, #2 70ml, #3/4/5 60ml) 45s between the pours
* Coffee Beans: Two Bears COLOMBIA INZÁ CAUCA (Roasted on December 29th 2020)
* Grinder/Size: Niche Zero - I'd say medium coarse. I'm past the 50 point, more towards the center of the rear hinge for those that know what it looks like. 
* Kettle/Temperature: EKG Electric kettle by Fellows @ 100c, I first rinse my filter by the time I'm actually using the water it's cooled down to around 96c. 
* Amount &amp; Ratio: 20g/300ml (1:15) 
* Tasting/feel notes: Acidic but not terribly sour almost pleasant, definitely a sour smell but nothing revolting &amp; a little thin almost tea like

While I do enjoy making cups of coffee I only have so many times in a day I can make myself a cup. I limit myself to two 300ml ""cups"". I've tried the method above 3 times now. I'm looking for suggestions to those that have made and ""perfected - to their own liking"" this method (or others). 

My goal is to have a more balanced cup and a slightly more rich mouth feel. While my current results are definitely drinkable, they aren't to my liking.  I'd like to move away from the acidity a little bit (not so much as to remove it completely) and would like to have a little more...texture (I don't think that's the correct word here). It just feels a little thin.

Also any other methods where individuals have achieved a similar taste profile to what I'm looking for would be great. Also as an aside, what are people referring to when they say their coffee has ""sweetness"" because so far I haven't been able to discern any noticeable sweetness from my cups.

If I went to a coffee shop, must I ask for it to be French pressed? I think I have only seen an Expresso machine used. 

I've done some research and I am seeing that for every ounce of grinded coffee, you're supposed to use 17 grams of water after which you steep it four minutes. (I have no idea how to get that ratio as I don't measure strictly.)

Also rather than make a new post, what are your thoughts about brewed cacao using the coffee maker I have?",1611016245

Coffee,sunriseblck,l3i1of,Finally completed my dream pour-over setup,"*Processing img 9co5y47cq4d61...*

I got in a pour-over game almost a year ago, with the first lockdown. Not having a daily cup at a favorite coffee spot was a total no-go, so I bought my first Hario Switch and a cheap hand grinder and my coffee journey has begun.

Fast forward – here I am, at last fully satisfied with my gear. 

When more experienced coffee fellows were telling me that 80% of the cup flavor depends on the grinder (giving high quality and fresh beans, of course), I was thinking 'Nah, snobs'. 

Boy, I was wrong! Consistency in the grind and the water temperature gives so much to the cup. 

The downside is that I don't visit the coffeeshops so often these days, only a couple of times a month for an espresso shot :)",1611428473

Coffee,OccamsRazorstrop,l35vwd,"[Question, long-winded] I’m confused","Until recently I’ve never lived in a home where the coffee was more than barely drinkable. Parents, spouse, even my own. Or a workplace. All of them used common supermarket or coffee service coffee and a Mr. Coffee style brewer (or the commercial version thereof). Even restaurant coffee was typically no better, though it got slightly better on occasion.

Then I had my first cup of Starbucks and my world was rocked, especially by the dark or robust roasts. But even the lighter roasts were *vastly* superior to everyday coffee.

Then I found Keurig and after trying a gazillion different pods, came up with coffee which, if not *quite* as good as Starbucks was pretty close. And which put what I’d been drinking up until then to shame. (Which? Green Mountain Dark Magic is my go-to; Emeril’s Big Easy Bold is my alternate. I like the intensity of the DM, but the BEB has a bit more flavor. A lot of the other pod flavors don’t seem that much better than what I’d been drinking, Donut Shop being a ubiquitous example.)

Due to medical reasons, I’m not supposed to have more than 2 cups per day and I probably average 1.5, just one some days, 2 on others (especially during the winter). So making a whole pot isn’t practical and the Keurig fits in well for that, too.

But reading around on the Web, I find that everyone seems to think that the Keurig makes crappy coffee and that you’re an environmental criminal and a spendthrift if you use one. I can handle the additional expense, and grit my teeth and bear the environmental bit, but the crappy coffee part comes as a shock.

I’ve watched a couple of the V60 videos and I really just want to make a quick cuppa joe and drink it, not conduct a science experiment or play with my coffee. And looking at Starbucks, it looks to me like they make their coffee just like all the places I’ve been getting crappy coffee before discovering them.

So should I just continue with my Keurig, with which I was entirely happy until I learned too much? Is it possible to get single-serving coffee that’s better than the Keurig without having to play with it (or pay hundreds of dollars for equipment and/or have a coffee machine as big as a Buick in my kitchen)? And based on what I’ve said that I like, even if I went there would I be likely to actually like it more?

I’m just confused how Starbucks can be so much better than all my prior pre-Starbucks experience and whether it can be replicated, or improved upon, at home on a single-serve basis in a way that will really work and not involve a lot of effort, money or space.

I’m sorry if this is a FAQ",1611378981

Coffee,kljshfdi,l321tx,Questions about getting a Hario V60 instead of my generic cone dripper,"I'm no stranger to decent coffee.  I've been making pour-over coffee and am generally happy with my results, but I'm wondering if I should mix it up for variety and try a Hario V60 to try to get more out of my specialty beans.

I currently use a no-name ceramic cone, like a Kalita Wave with the flat bottom and three holes, but using standard Melitta No. 2 bleached filters instead of wave filters.  The wet filters definitely stick to the sides of the cone despite the gentle grooves molded into the ceramic and drain slowly.  I have a gooseneck kettle and use a Baratza Virtuoso grinder.  I feel like even with the better burrs of the Virtuoso, I get quite a bit of fines and poor particle distribution.  The coffee drains well the first time I pour water over it, but then clogs for successive pours.  I've played with the grind size to eventually get a ~6 minute drain time, but the coffee is definitely brewing partially in immersive mode, almost like a Clever dripper.

I actually like the coffee I get well enough, but I'm wondering if it's time to experiment with a different cone and recipe to get more out of my beans.  Would getting a Hario V60 be a likely improvement?  Will the shape of that cone, its ribs, and its filters drain quickly, even given my uneven grind?  I know some people complain about the new tabbed Hario filters, but are they adequate and do they drain fast enough?  I'm not really looking to hunt for elusive filter paper as a new hobby.

Coffee,halcyen,l2zn5c,1zpresso Q2 fines issue,"Hi everybody!

I'm quite new to alternative brewing methods.

For v60 brewing decided to buy a good entry level manual grinder and got Q2 from aliexpress.

TL;DR:

1. The brand new Q2 grinder produces a lot of fines tested at marks 18-22 IMO. Is it defected?
2. The burrs doesn't seem to be perfectly aligned which is really noticeable at mark 1.
3. The total brewing time starting from blooming using 27-30g per 500ml varies from 4 to 6 minutes, the drawdown is usually quite long. Tried both Hoffman/Rao spin and no spin.
4. The coffee bed usually looks muddy with some extra mud layer on the side walls. And these amounts exclude the fines stuck to the grinder walls due to static, which varies.
5. The coffee roasted for filter brewing usually tastes quite bitter and unpleasant.
6. Is there a way to fix this issue by disassembly and trying to align burrs, or maybe the consistency may normalize as the burr wears out a bit?
7. Don't want to consider Kruve as solution due to highly controversial reviews and opinions, a cheap sieve from ali maybe.

[Coffee bed photos](https://imgur.com/a/zU78Qwp), the cracks may be due to touching filter after the brewing.

I chose Q2 cause it seems to be built better than Xeoleo and even Timemore's C2 which still has plastic parts and other issues discussed in this subreddit.

But to my regret Q2  turned out to be a disappointment due to quite large amounts of fines. I guess the burrs are not perfectly aligned though the shaft is ok (no wobbling while spinning on the handle).

The burr is blocked at mark 0 but at mark 1+- there is quite noticeable friction like 1/2 the way, no prominent rattle like with some Xeoleos but a distinct rustle.

I ejected burr and cleaned the grinder a few times, which haven't solved the issue yet. Haven't tried a deeper disassembly though.

I tested like 6 different beans by now, some produced more fines at 18-22, some less, but still enough to make coffee bed muddy and brewing long. The filters used are the original Hario v60 in a carton and the kettle is a gooseneck.

Please help or share your opinions on the issue, would be grateful.",1611357240

As a hand grinder my options so far seem like: Hario Slim Plus Mini, Hario Sketron Plus, Timemore C2 (even though it is a little bit off my budget) What would you recommend to me buy?

Espresso newbie here. My brother gave me his Breville Barista Express in the fall (long story!) and I’ve really been getting into espresso since. 

I’ve also been enjoying lots of my local roasters (Montreal, QC), and am noticing that a roaster will usually have one style of beans labelled ‘Espresso roast’, and then a whole host of other beans. I know that espresso roasts lend themselves to being used in an espresso machine (duh), but does it also mean that I should stick to dark roasts/espresso roasts for my BBE?

Coffee,Salty_Earth,l2popm,Amount of coffee for a cafetiere,"Hello, 

I'm new to coffee. I recently brought a flavoured instant variety to try and I liked it. I used 1-1.5 teaspoons of this instant to make around 250-300ml of coffee.

I recently moved to pre ground flavoured cafetiere coffee. My question is, how many grams of ground coffee should I use to make a similar 250-300ml cup of coffee? I use a 3 cup cafetiere and use around 7 grams (I weighed it and it's 1 tablespoon + 1/2 teaspoon). I use this as I read that the average cup has 70mg of caffeine in it and the flavoured Arabica beans I use are suppose to have 10mg of caffeine per gram. Is this a correct amount? As I've seen people saying they use nearly double this, but I'm not sure if this is due to a different strength in bean or if it's people preferring a very strong coffee.

Any information is greatly appreciated",1611328446

Coffee,olivepepys,l2mbg1,Coffee newbie after some help,"Hi Everyone, 

I used to drink coffee every day growing up, grew out of it as a young adult but now would like ot get back into it, both for drinking coffee and for also a morning ritual. My parents have one of those all in one bean to cup machines, but they're hideously expensive and I've never been blow away by the coffee.  My auntie however has a drip through set up and the coffee is brilliant.  My partner knew i was looking into it so for my birthday last week bought me a V60 and a coffee subscription to Django.

I've started out with Hoffmans method (60:40 with a swirl) but just want some general tips on things I need to change or improve.  Making coffee is a bit like an experiment so I''ve been focussed on just getting the right technique rather than changing everything and having no clue what was good or bad.  Some info on what i do is below;

* 18g to 300ml water
* overall brew time just over 3 minutes
* water is straight from the kettle so probably high 90's temp wise

main issue i have with the technique is that Hoffman says to create a well and then wet the grind with water twice as much as the weight of the coffee, in this case 36g, then swirl to make sure they are completely wet.  this ratio doesn't seem to give me enough time to swirl before it passes through, is it ok to increase the water amount?  My understanding of this bloom phase is to get rid of the Co2 from the grounds before extraction, so it seems quite important?

I am also finding that the grinds keep getting swept up the side of the filter, I think this is because i have a normal kettle so the flow is a bit strong.  i push them back down into the slurry with a spoon, is this ok?  At the end of the extraction I have a nice flat bed but there is quite a bit of coffee stuck on the filter in the V60 channels, photo attached. Is this normal?

other general bits that i could do with some help on are;

* grind - the coffee comes pre ground, i've attached a photo of the grind to get help on whether this is coarse/fine and even.  It also says it was ground in November, whilst this isn't freshly ground, does it class as old??  I can change the subscription to beans but can someone then recommend a decent manual grinder (budget is £50-100)
* Water - i use tap water but live in a soft water area, should i really use filtered?
* Coffee - is there a good standard coffee (UK) everyone knows that would be a good baseline for me to start with?  i don't know if the coffee i have is good or not

I'm new to all this and just trying to get better, the cups i've produced this week have been better and more consistent than last week.  I'm just looking to see what the limiting factors are in my current set up/method and what things i should/could change to get better returns

I also read the post about pour over tips for beginners and not to complicate it.  Interestingly, i don't find the hoffman method particularly complicated.  It was a bit overwhelming coming in here to see people talking about various ratios, temperatures and techniques, but once you read into it more it's generally quite straight forward.  i went through Hoffmans video and just noted 8 steps to follow, if you work out the weight of both water and coffee before hand it's quite simple and easily repeatable.  Admittedly, I do have a background in labwork, which does help quite a bit.

Anyway, apologies for the lengthy post, just trying to give everyone the detail and i'm interested to learn more and get better at this.",1611316868

Coffee,tastedeadkiller,l2kbzb,Budget Grinder Recommendations for Espresso,"Hey everybody, as a student I just got into the espresso game a few months ago by buying a Delonghi Dedica EC685. Since the difference between a preground coffee and a freshly ground one is huge, I decided to buy a grinder as well. Since my machine uses a pressurized basket, I know that the consistency of my grind will not matter that much, as it does in machines with non-pressurized baskets. My budget is around 50 Euros. From what I read, I should invest in a hand grinder rather than an electronic burr grinder like Delonghi KG89 or something else in the same price range. As a hand grinder my options so far seem like: Hario Slim Plus Mini, Hario Sketron Plus, Timemore C2 (even though it is a little bit off my budget) What would you recommend to me buy?

p.s. I also occasionally brew coffee with a french press, but I hope that every hand grinder could grind that course. So I did not mention it above :)",1611308132

I am a noob when it comes to making coffee. So please excuse my 'language/terms'. 

Recently bought a Gaggia espresso machine. I have been putting 12g of coffee. But I am not quite sure when should I stop the extraction process. Someone told me its 20 seconds and another person told me stop extraction when the extraction stats loosing color and looks watery. 

How many ml of coffee should be extracted per gram of coffee? For instance how many ml should be extracted for 12 ? 

Also. I usually let the handle stay in the machine for a minute or so before taking it off (that's what the instructor suggested me). However I noticed that, while I try to remove the handle, the pressure isn't released yet and it throws the handle downwards. I hope I explained this well.

It doesn't replace my espresso or my pourover or turkish, and it's nothing like my filter machine at home, kindof a class to itself.  Is there anyone else out there like me who misses that?

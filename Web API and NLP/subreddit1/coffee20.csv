Coffee,overextraction,l4k383,Can immersion have the same strength as espresso?,"What brewing method has the higher possible strength: Immersion or percolation?

In another thread it was argued that because of the faster extraction speed of percolation, espresso can achieve a strength that immersion methods can't. 

I would argue that water has a max concentration of soluble material. Immersion (given enough time) will reach this concentration/strength. Percolation extracts faster, but at best it extracts until it is fully saturated (at the same strength that immersion reaches) and if not ideal, will leave the coffee bed undersaturated. This leads me to the conclusion that immersion and percolation can reach the same strength (all other variables being equal). I would even say that immersion will generally have more strength than percolation. 

If we were to use an espresso grind size and typical espresso ratio in an Aeropress, we should be able to get a strength similar to espresso.

Am I wrong? Does anybody here have a refractometer to verify this?",1611565504

Coffee,GuyThirteen,l4fmye,Constantly swirling a pourover,"We know from extraction theory that percolation brews (such as pourovers) can ultimately extract more than immersion brews because fresh water is constantly being added, and this better facilitates osmosis out of the beans. We also know that the difficulty with pourovers is ensuring even extraction.

So, why not just pour all of your water in one go, while constantly swirling your brew vessel, until you've hit your target weight? It would solve the evenness problem, but it would achieve more extraction than immersion brews because water is constantly being replaced. You'd achieve a complex pourover brew, but with no technical skill required. If you wanted to, you could change extraction speed by just changing pouring speed, and tweak the flavor that way.

I've tried this, and couldn't tell a difference between it and Hoffman's pourover method--but my technique for the latter wasn't perfect, and my pallete is untrained, so I can't make any conclusions. What do you think? And what problems are there with my theory?",1611547858

This subreddit has helped me immensely to start off on my coffee journey, so posting here now to figure out what next.

I'm currently using a Moka Pot and a Timemore C2, and have really been enjoying some freshly roasted medium and dark beans in it. I like the Moka for the strong espresso-like coffee it brews and find it very yummy.

I don't how weird this sounds, but I tend to not enjoy regular coffee too much because it's just too much liquid for drinking coffee to me. Even regular americanos at that. I prefer smaller and stronger doses, hence the Moka. I know the logical next step would be espresso, but I live on a student budget. I've been eyeing the Flair but it's still some months/years away for me. So, what can I use to brew coffee next to explore the world more?

Since getting my Baratza Grinder and revisiting my Aeropress after years and discovering this awesome reddit I've been obsessed with coffee at home.  As per recommendations in this thread I went down the rabbit hole of buying from awesome roasters all over the world.  They all showed up this weekend and I think I ordered a bit too much coffee lol.

How long do beans stay good from the time they're roasted?

How long do beans stay good once they're open?

Bonus question, how do you guys typically seal your beans?  

Our local roaster has a bendable plastic type thing that seals it shut on the outside once you roll it down.  Beans from B&amp;W don't seem to have this so I just used the sticker to tape the top to the bag after I rolled it down.  Is this sufficient?

Coffee,JFAT99,l4ataq,"Do combinations of espresso and filter coffee, or two filtering methods, exist?","I recently thought that it might be a good experiment to make a coffee drink based on the blending of two different methods. And it strikes me that there's no evidence of anything like it existing in the internet, which might be for two causes: it's horrible and an extremely bad idea, which someone tried and is ashamed to admit; or no one even thought about it.

What do you say?

I have thought of two possible combinations:

First, some kind of Americano. Espresso and, instead of water, a filtered coffee that maybe should be light and clean (Chemex perhaps), obviously bringing up some tastes the espresso might lack, thus making a complete pallette of flavours.

Second, the combination, now, of two filtered coffees by different methods. Again, obviously, the flavours should complement each other. This can be more experimental in textures, given that two immersion methods can bring up their characteristics (like the sediment and the bitterness), maybe playing among them, or contrasting them with the more sweet and lighter body of the drip methods. In these blends, proportions should play also a major role, I suppose.

And, in both cases, maybe one could also experiment with different beans for each method.

Anyway, let me know what you think.",1611531887

The display will show the lines and the unit will stop working requiring a restart. Sometimes the water will be boiling (water spurting out the top) and the temperature read out will still show 80 degrees celcius. Other times, the temperature read out while its boiling will go up and down by about 20 degrees, from 70 to 90. I had believed the unit to be defective so I contacted the retailer and they insisted that the unit was fine even though I told them about all my issues. Since I didn't appreciate that response, I contacted Fellow, who confirmed with me that my kettle was having issues, but since I wasn't located in the US, I would have to go through my retailer.

Well, Hazel and Hershey has basically ghosted me. I sent them multiple messages on instagram and they left me on read, and I also sent them emails which they have not responded to in the last few weeks. I am not sure what I can do to resolve my issue which is why I turn to Reddit. I guess I wanted to see if anyone could point me in some direction of a solution to the faulty kettle such as some other distributor that would honour the warranty or if someone has a contact at Fellow that would apply some pressure from the retailer point of view. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with how Hazel and Hershey has dealt with the situation, and I would urge any readers to avoid purchasing coffee or other products from them. I had bought coffee from them on a weekly basis since they were my favourite roaster in Hong Kong, but it is evident that they don't care about their customers.

For any future potential Fellow customers, make sure you know who you're getting the warranty from, so as to not end up in a situation like me where the retailer ghosts you after you've spent $200 USD, and the manufacturer cannot assist.

I consider myself a pretty proficient hobbyist; I've got about 5 or 6 years under me doing pourovers. I spent several cups trying to get it dialed in and, while it was good, it wasn't really anything special to me. I don't usually get blends, so I didn't really know what to expect. It kind of just tasted like generic coffee. I had some other bags from the same roaster I liked much better, so I just decided to grind up quite a bit of that blend and throw it in our $10 walmart autodrip machine - just eyeballing the water level. To my complete surprise, the resulting pot of coffee was absolutely amazing and nothing like how my v60 tasted. Very fruity, chocolatey finish, pretty much perfect in every way. This was by far the best pot of coffee I've ever made in an autodrip machine, let alone the cheapest autodrip machine my friend and I could find (we bought it so we'd have a large volume of coffee to take on jobs with us, not for the quality of said coffee).

So long story short, I'm now working on reevaluating my technique. I think slower pouring is a good place to start to maybe kind of mimic the relatively slow drip of the machine.

It still produces a nice grind consistency, but I'm looking for something with a smaller footprint and want to make it easier to switch between different brew methods. 

I'm going back and fourth between a second hand Vario (which I'll upgrade with steel burrs) and a new 1zpresso JX Pro.

For the last year I've rarely touched my Gaggia classic and have been drinking from my Bialetti/V60 exclusively, but I would like to keep the ability to dial in for espresso as an option.

I was wondering what your grind times with the 1zpresso are. How long does it take to grind about 15-18 grams for pour over? I heard it takes some people ~20 seconds, others are talking 60 seconds and up. Is it really a pain to grind for espresso on a daily basis? I brew about 4 times a day on average.

I've made 4 cups using the grinder the last three grinder settings being 15, 20 and then 28. 
The 28 is the best so far but still just a little over bitter.

I think it goes deeper than that. Like the type of cotton will depend largely on specifically which hill the sheep grew up on, and also might have to do with the pitch of the shepherd's voice. If the shepherd has a more shrill, high-pitched voice, it is more likely to produce a more coarse kind of cotton. I personally prefer cotton as soft as it gets, with coffee as black as midnight on a moonless night, drank on an empty stomach so I can feel the caffeine take over my bloodstream.

I personally think it's the way you make coffee there. You make it black and watery and then if you add milk, you just pour it in or at the most fancy you foam it in afterwards. Both of these are just wrong. In our culture, you start by boiling milk, you make a really f'in strong coffee concentrate, and then add that to the boiling milk. Then you aerate and mix it by using 2 containers and swapping it back and forth between them. And ir actually tastes good this way and strong, amazing that.

Coffee,No-Cancel6798u,l3q51h,A coffee adventure in Flint," I decided to visit the local grocery store north of downtown looking to buy a bag of coffee. I parked my car in the open lot where a homeless man immediately blocked off my car and came over to beg for money. Initially, I wasn’t afraid so I ignored him until he started tapping on my window. Going through every worst case scenario in my head I decided against trying to pull out of the lot in case he was armed for whatever reason. I calmly rolled down my window slightly and gave him all the money I had which was roughly $2 in change. At this point, the man walked to the passenger side door and began yanking the handle muttering something about how I needed to take him to the atm and give him a lot of money. Still being afraid he was armed I said that I had to get coffee from the store and couldn’t take him to the atm. To this he said that he would escort me to the store. Inside the store he began screaming “my nephew needs coffee...y’all got coffee??” Repeatedly until the owner showed up. Since he was not wearing a mask, he was promptly kicked out. he turned to me and said he would wait for me outside. I asked the store owner if she minded that I camp out inside until the man left. She was fine with that idea but recommended that she could escort me out and tell the man to leave the property. I agreed and got to my car but the man still followed so the store owner told him to leave. To this the man looked at me and laughed saying, “you should’ve told me, y’all are white suprematists” and then went on his way screaming that we were a bunch of racists. This was definitely the most interesting shopping experience I’ve ever had.

Coffee,xtrasimplicity,l3nm29,Finally tried “fruity” coffee - and I love it!,"TL;DR: Recently tried single-origin, fruity beans from Nicaragua as my normal beans weren’t in stock. I love the flavour, and am keen to try other amazing options out there. Any suggestions? I’m located in Australia.

Hi all,

I bought a Delonghi super automatic coffee machine at the start of covid to get my daily coffee fix whilst working from home, and have been purchasing Jamaica Blue’s (a cafe franchise here in Australia) “signature-blend” beans ever since.

I liked the flavour of these beans, but they were out of stock when I went to buy more beans yesterday, so I ended up picking up a pack of their seasonal, limited edition single origin (titled El peñón) beans from Nicaragua, which have pineapple, cocoa and blueberry undertones.

I’ve had a few cups of this new coffee and now realise I really like these “fruity” coffees, and would love to try some different options in the coming weeks, once I finish this bag.

Do you have any recommendations of fruity (whether aromatic, or taste, or both), or other amazing coffees that I should try? I feel like I’ve been missing out on a lot of great coffees out there by repeatedly purchasing the same Jamaica Blue beans.

As I’m located in Australia, it’d be great to either pick them up in store or buy online from somewhere that delivers to Australia and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.

Coffee,makestocksgreatagain,l3lohz,Filtering Pourover Coffee Twice,"Hi All,

Was recently at a local coffee shop and found their pourover method interesting. Basically, they filter their pourover coffee twice through the dripper. Letting it filter once and then again, pouring the coffee through the filter a second time. 

My theory on this is the method is for the masses and more error-proof. Obviously, it takes time and technique to properly pour filter coffee and not over/under extract the coffee. And by filtering twice, essentially that “error-proofs” the coffee flavors. The overly bitterness or acidity gets filtered out the second time. The trade off here is that the coffee does not have any prominent flavors thus resulting in a more light tasting coffee. Which I feel like is for the masses and generally people prefer lighter coffee. It also seems less time consuming as the barista doesn’t have to wait and pour. 

Thoughts? Is there some kind of science behind this?",1611439331

Hello,

I'm relatively new to the coffee lifestyle and have run into a bit of an issue. My Keurig recently died and I am looking for some replacement options. Now I don't need anything too fancy, and I'd actually like to step away from using pods or k cups because I hate all the waste they produce. I'm the only coffee drinker in the household, so I don't need anything that can brew several cups at a time, although it's not awful if it includes a carafe. I've got pods left over, so if there is an option for pods that's cool, if not no biggie.

I need some suggestions from the coffee experts. I've done some research and feel like the Cuisinart SS10 and the Hamilton Beach Flex brew are kind of what I'm looking for. Anybody have experience with either of these or have something else to recommend?  Price point of around $100 US (a little more is fine) feels good.

Coffee,smol-lebowski,laoxe5,RO Water,"So I hit a coffee slump these past few weeks. I haven't been making great pourover cups like I used to.
Back then, I didn't know that its a sin to use RO water when brewing cuppas &amp; that's what I used. Alongside a Hario Mill &amp; an origami dripper. I think I made good cups out of em.

Then I ran into an issue with my induction hob, which resulted to me buying an electric Stagg.
Then I figured, might as well upgrade to a Comandante; which I did.

But after these upgrades, the cups I've been making were just meh.
Either too bitter, flat, and no flavor notes coming right out.
So I tried a bunch of things.
Pretty much all grind settings with different flow rates.
Even down to making my own brew water and it's still a hit or miss. I cant consistenly make a good cuppa.

So this morning, I decided to go back to my og hario kettle thru induction, using RO water. &amp; booooy the flavors came popping right out again.
Now im just at a loss for words cause I cant explain how the softest water can bring the flavors out of my beans and not with a SCA standard brew water.",1612245576

Coffee,johnAckerman777,laov4o,I am new to making coffee at home.,"Hello everyone, as the headline said I am new to making coffee at home and i have some General questions and I would love some feed back :) 

I Recently started making coffee at home because I realized I was spending so much a month on coffee and espresso to the tune of 100-150 a month, so I decided to buy a French press and whole bean coffee. I enjoy the more hands on approach and didn't want to bother with Instant coffee hoping I could get a better brew. 

So a few of my questions are sense I am using a french press I am grinding my Coffee beans fairly course and would it be safe to flush them down the sink or would It clog my sink pipes? I am a little concerned that it might and I can't seem to find a straight forward answer when looking on google. 

My second question, the beans I bought are from jumping bean, specifically there french Colombian dark roast, I enjoy the flavors of dark roasted coffee however I do like the lighter roasted coffee aswell. 
I would love to have some recommendations and maybe links to websites where I can find the perfect type for me if that is possible for you guys to help me with :) 

My third and final question revolves around the French press I am using, how would I go about making the coffee more consistent, steeping times, Amount Of ground coffee per litre of Water any and all help and foresight would be very appreciated. 

Much thanks from a very big coffee loving Canadian.",1612245321

Coffee,jessi-poo,lakgoy,Breville Dual Boiler - how to open up??,"I need to get to the OPV and pop the top open to do so. (for reference, with a blank disc it's only getting up to 9-9.5 so my shots, it never has, my machine is 2 months old, won't go higher than 8.5 on a good day for my espresso, my shots taste weak).

So I found some tutorials that explained there are 4 screws:

* 2 on the back you need torque heads, I got those out since I have the bit, no issues
* 2 next to the group head

I can't for the life of me get the 2 next to the group head to budge.

* I tried my little dremel drill on a weak setting with the extension, doesn't work so I figured maybe the thickness of the extension was blocking at some point and it wasn't reaching the screw head
* I got a 0x3 and a 1x4 Philips screwdriver from a neighbor, still not working! I can't get either of those 2 screws to budge at all. They will not move. Screwdrivers are on the pointier side and maybe it doesn't have that great of a grip but for it to not move at all
* I tried another one of my skinny weak screwdrivers this time with a flat head just to try to latch onto something, couldn't turn it at all, I was turning red from exhaustion

I'm stumped, nobody else has had this issue. I just see posts with the thing open and to remove the screws but not 1 comment about the difficulty top open this thing up. Is there a trick to this? I even tried putting it down so it's lying down, having my opposite hand push back on the top while I try to jam the screwdriver to really get a good grip - still no. I'm not sure what they did in the Breville factory for it to be stuck in there so good!

EDIT: After scouring the internet for 2 hours, I found 1 single post that mentions this [https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/breville-dual-boiler-mods-and-maintenance-t61421-140.html](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/breville-dual-boiler-mods-and-maintenance-t61421-140.html) A helpful user mentions: JIS #2 screwdriver or bits

Coffee,Waryur,lajquq,At a local 3rd wave café the espresso tastes... kind of gross?,"I like espresso. At least I thought I like espresso. I would always be sure to get a ""free sample"" from the Nespresso machine that they had at Crate and Barrel before the pandemic. When at an Italian restaurant I like to get one after the meal, as they do in Italy. But I just can't stand the espresso at this café I like. Their regular coffee pot coffee and pourovers are excellent, and they have good pastries and sandwiches. But every time I've gotten an espresso from there it's just Battery Acid. I recently got a cappucino and it had an odd sourness—I can't tell if the milk had gone or if that was just their espresso. I know that this place, like most ""nice"" cafés nowadays, really push the fruity light roasts, and that Italians tend to like a darker roast. But I can't even imagine this stuff being drinkable?? I have a Breville Bambino and Trader Joe's ""Espresso Blend"" (blend of arabica and robusta, allegedly ""light-medium"" roast but the beans are rather oily!) and while it's not the super authentic beautiful espresso because it uses one of those ""cheaty"" double-wall baskets, I enjoy the taste of that stuff infinitely more than the café's espresso. Is this just me not being used to light-roast espresso or are they doing it wrong... and if it's their fault how can I politely tell them I'm not impressed?",1612228490

Coffee,CoffeeandTech72,lad5gm,Coffee journey - Share yours or just come and chat!,"Going years back I never enjoyed coffee. I became used to the thought that strong coffee meant it almost had a burnt taste in an Americano. I drank it for the caffeine but never looked forward to having it, in fact, I prefered energy drinks. However, when I discovered there was more to coffee than Starbucks, that changed quickly. 

I chose to study abroad in Melbourne, Australia. For those of you who aren't familiar, I was in for a treat because Melbourne is considered the coffee capital of Australia. I began checking different cafes out still getting my usual Americano but I started to discover different tastes each time. I couldn't spot the difference but I knew it was there. I fell in love with coffee the taste of coffee while I was there!

When I returned I eventually ended up working for Starbucks (not for the coffee but more for their scholarship for college). However, this choice changed my life. I realized how much goes into the craft of coffee. I participated in coffee tastings, experimented with espresso, paired coffee with a pastry to bring out the notes mores, etc. Now, Starbucks gets a bad rep for some of their coffee but they did have a few that were surprisingly good. This opened my eyes to specialty coffee and specialty coffee shops. I am addicted to the TASTE of coffee rather than the caffeine it contains. I've had coffee where it tastes surprisingly fruity, flowery, and some with nice sweet acidity. I love the massive variety and potential that lies within each cup! This is what I wake up for every day!!

Now, I just want to learn more about coffee and continue to expand my knowledgebase and hopefully open a cafe one day!

Going to Melbourne, Australia and working for Starbucks changed my life in a way I would never have guessed. When did you all find your passion for coffee? What are you doing now to continue expanding your skills/knowledge of coffee?",1612211218

Coffee,EddyIsReady,laa8kn,Constant Flat tasting Pour Over - Need Help,"I really hate the fact that I'm making this post. I'm a self-proclaimed coffee nerd and long time enthusiast. I've been seriously brewing pour over coffee for three years with great mid-range gear and fresh specialty coffee. I've come to this problem where I can't seem to get flavors out of my coffee, and each cup tastes flat and lacks depth. I think my main culprit here is channeling, but I'm not sure what to do or how to diagnose.

&amp;#x200B;

I grind with the Lido 3 at a similar grind size to Square Mile's sample grinds. I bought a new Lido 3 a couple months ago, upgrading from my Baratza Encore. This past year I've been brewing mostly with a v60 (Jame's Hoffman's recipe), but also own a Kalita Wave and Clever Dripper. Being in Seattle, I have great access to high quality freshly roasted specialty beans. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days ago I went to my favorite cafe and had some Panama beans on pour over. The coffee distinctly tasted like chocolate and strawberries. It was a vibrant cup and I had no issue picking out those tasting notes. Delicious cup. I decided to buy the beans with a roast date of 1/26 and wanted to replicate these flavors at home. The shop I went to used a Kalita Wave, but I've brewed three cups so far on a V60 and none of them have been close to what I tasted at the cafe. As my coffee cools the strawberry and chocolate come out, but it's maybe 50% of what I was tasting from the cafe.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good, clean grinder. I use filtered water, I have around 3 minute brew times and have a flat clean bed every time. What can I possibly do to diagnose what's going on? Should I switch to french press for a bit? Go back to my Kalita Wave? Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

And a long shot here, but would anyone be interested in a coffee related discord or similar community? I really think I've gotten to the point I need someone to watch me make pour over and critique me. I'm really getting disappointed with these consistently flat and boring cups.

Edit: thanks for everyone's help so far. I brewed a French press and it had the same boring flavor. I'm going to continue experimenting with water until I get my French press to taste good, then move on to the kalita.",1612204192

I use some random Starbucks light roast beans, a blade grinder and a drip coffee machine. I know that to you, that probably doesn't sound too great haha 

But with whole milk, it smells like raspberries and tastes really sweet. But because you guys told me how milk covers up many aspects of coffee, I intentionally drank a cup or two of coffee with milk, and a small coffee cup with black coffee every morning for a week. 

And now, I decided that I might as well not use milk at all this time because it's actually pretty good. It's a lot stronger and kinda fruity. The raspberry taste is totally gone when drinking it black (you did also say that milk can also bring out new flavors, which it does for this coffee), but drinking this black reminds me of drinking tea. 

Thank you for pushing me, I feel like my eyes have opened lmao I feel like I got a better idea of how coffee is supposed to be drunk (just being mindful of what different additives do to coffee. So if I want this tea-like coffee, I'll drink it black. And if I want that Starbucks taste, I'll use milk) and I'm so excited about getting into pour-over coffee and stuff like that. Maybe I'll even get a burr grinder one day or something (for now, that's kinda expensive since I'm just a 19yo student).

I have been using it daily since that time.
I always make sure the water is to max before starting coffees, the hopper has beans, and I let it heat up for ~20 mins before starting anything.

It sounded like everything was normal, but only a small amount dripped and was very bitter. Ended up with ~ 1tsp of drip.

Last night I cleaned the entire machine. This morning I did the usual 20 minute wait then made my first double shot - perfect. The second shot had the same issue as yesterday!

Coffee,burned_pixel,la3tuv,Nespresso as an americano is not horrible,"So, hey y'all. I hope everyone's doing great.

At home, I am the coffee loving person. My father comes in as a close second, but he always puts simplicity before flavor, so ""good"" instant coffee and nespresso are his go to. I grind my own beans and brew my Java in ways he considers exaggerated, though for the average r/coffee User they would be pretty average. So, we keep two nespresso machines in the house.

Recently my kitchen has had some work being done to it, so my usual coffee heaven is out of service for a little while. Personally I can't stand instant coffee since I started brewing my own, there's just a metallic taste to it, so I turned to the second worst option, nespresso. I know what everyone here about their coffee, but imo it's not nearly as bad as people here make it to be, though there is room for improvement. 

What solution did I find? An Americano. I pull an espresso sized shot out of the machine, let the capsule fall through, and press the button once again to let some hot water flow into my coffee, essentially doubling its size. It really helps masks those weird flavours associated with nespresso coffee, but still giving a somewhat strong coffee. I hope this helps anyone.

Cheers everybody!

EDIT: First of all, a silver for this simple thread? Thank you stranger!! Secondly, I think the conversation got really interesting. I agree with most of you, nespresso is not terrible, specially when there are extra steps taken (adding water for an americano, milk, condensed milk, etc.).

I am planning to sell some of my fresh roasted coffee online. In your opinion, what is the best alternative? And is it worth shedding the extra $ for the degassing valves?

Thanks",1612174591

Coffee,redditinface,l9vhvd,"What's the least amount of coffee I can make? (Or rather, make well)","This subreddit has made me obsessed in the last couple of months. Now all I want to do is read about coffee making methods, try new techniques, and continually tweak my recipe. Bought an Encore, a Wave, a Clever dripper and a scale, and haven't looked back. (Not true. Yesterday I looked back long enough to order a JX Pro.)

Here's my problem: I'm incredibly sensitive to caffeine, so I've been using 9g coffee and 150g water in my Clever dripper. But I haven't seen anyone use less than 15/250, so I'm wondering if I'm limiting my coffee quality by trying to make such a small amount. (Because of poor heat retention? Some other mechanism I'm not thinking of?) I could of course just make 15/250, but that will tempt me to overcaffeinate and be up half the night. But if I must to pursue perfection, so be it.

Thoughts?",1612156268

Coffee,201power,l9u6r9,V60 pour over: which stage contribute most to after odor / taste?,"One thing I enjoyed a lot from pour over is the long lingering after odor /  taste.

Which stage of pour over contribute most to the after odor / taste?

I did a quick experiment today, use April's V60 recipe, with Lily dripper. Total 4 pours  and for each pour use different cup.

Recipe: 13g coffee, 200g 195F water, C40 30 click grind size

4 x 50g pour every 30 seconds. between each pour water drained completed. total time 2:00

Result

* 1st 50g: sharp acidity
* 2nd 50g: sweet aroma, less acidity than 1st 50g, some after ordor
* 3rd 50g: very sweet, some after ordor
* 4th 50g: a little sweet, tea like taste

Then I combine:

* 1st + 2nd: very bright and acidic
* 1st + 2nd + 3rd: acidity become more acceptable 
* 1st + 2nd + 3rd + 4th: balance of acidity and sweetness. much more after ordor / taste

It seems the 4th pour contribute most to the after taste. Any people have similar finding?

According to BH, largest molecular contribute most to  Retronasal olfactional. **does this mean later stage of pour extract more large molecular**? If increase water ratio more, will I get even stronger after taste?

Coffee,mandelbrot_tea_set,l9pv7p,"French press, should we switch to cloth filters? How to use/clean?","Hi all, we're thinking of switching to cloth filters for our french press but not sure if it's a good idea or how to handle them correctly.

We're pretty casual coffee drinkers. For daily use we have an [OXO burr grinder](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B07CSKGLMM) set to grind 10 seconds on max coarseness. We put that and a pinch of salt into [this cheap Bayka french press](https://www.amazon.com/BAYKA-French-Double-Wall-Filtration-Dishwasher/dp/B07VFFZF7H/ref=sr_1_13_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=french+press&amp;qid=1612136584&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sr=1-13-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMTlVT0FLTVBVWDUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1NDc2MDAxUzdERlZIN01CTVhHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwNDIxODEyQkVPQ0U4OUpHUTJVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and fill it up with 200F water, steep for 4 minutes, then plunge and drink.

A few months ago our metal mesh filters started to fray along the ""seam"" so we ordered replacements. It happens periodically, we thought it was normal. The new ones were already a bit frayed when we got them so we figured it was a bad seller and ordered some other ones. Same thing happened so we ordered the ""Amazon's choice"" option. Those doesn't even have a ""seam"", just a sharp metal edge lightly folded over that's also already frayed.

At this point we're wondering:

* Can we get decent metal mesh filters anywhere?
* Is it worth switching to a cloth filter like [these polyester ones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JU89OGE/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) instead? 
* If so, do we need to change the way we grind to properly make use of them? What's the right way to clean them?
* If both metal and polyester are bad options, what's better? Paper?

Thank you for any advice, it's appreciated!",1612138229
Coffee,hope_still_flies,l9pl9g,Found Behmor Brazen at Restore for $15...full of mold!,"I use a Kalita daily for myself but have been looking at getting a good auto drip brewer for making batches (I have an old Mr Coffee that hasn’t been touched in ages). I was feeling pretty close to pulling the trigger on a $150 machine when I happen to be wandering through a Habitat Restore and saw a used Behmor Brazen Plus 3.0 on the shelf for $15!  I hear stories of people finding cool coffee gear for cheap at thrift shops, but never figured I’d be so lucky. Well maybe I was lucky and maybe I wasn’t because I pulled open the basket and it had been left with the grounds for who knows how long and was FULL of mold. Could I get it clean? For $15 I had to give it a try. I spent the better part of the day today disassembling it to clean it out all the way. Let me tell you what, taking apart at Brazen is not for the faint of heart. I wrecked some of the exterior plastic casing trying to pry here and there and was sure I wouldn’t turn on by the time I got it back together. But I got into the shower head and the channel between the reservoir and got all the mold clear (yes it had grow almost all the way up through to the reservoir). Got it all back together and it seems to function 100%! Still need to figure it out and run some more water through it (first batch was a little bleachy) but I’m pretty thrilled about picking up a $200 machine for $15 (and some elbow grease). If anyone has any tips please share. I have an Encore grinder and need to figure out my grind size",1612137418

Coffee,nosrac6221,l9n49d,Resting period horror story!,"About 3 weeks ago I ordered coffee from the renowned roaster La Cabra in Denmark, it was a pack with 3x250g of their standard coffees and 1x100 of a special semi-carbonic maceration process Gesha from Gesha Village in Ethiopia. Needless to say I was so excited to try the Gesha. When it finally arrived to the USA, the 3 standard coffees were 2 weeks off roast and I was confused that the Gesha had been roasted 8 days prior to the other 3 coffees (even before I placed the order)! I was so scared that it would be past its prime, so I immediately set to work trying to dial in this coffee - but every cup came out tasting very flat, whether extracted for 2:45 or 4:00 or in between. I felt as though they had sent me stale coffee and was quite upset. But in the back of my mind I had the idea that perhaps they intentionally sent me coffee that had rested longer. Maybe this coffee needed a particularly long resting period. So with only less than half of the beans left I decided to wait another week before brewing this Gesha again. Lo and behold, the coffee has developed substantially and is now quite delicious (1 month off roast). I will be waiting a few more days even to brew the last 2 cups.

I should have figured that real professionals like La Cabra knew what they were doing sending me older coffee. And it is quite remarkable that the other coffees I ordered were ready to drink straight away (2 weeks off roast)! Some coffees really do take different times to develop after roasting, hopefully this can help you all avoid running through a lot of beans trying to make an elusive cup that will not taste good no matter what recipe.",1612130244

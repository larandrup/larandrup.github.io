I am or better was not a coffee drinker. For my birthday 2 years back I got a small coffee machine (Nescafé Dolce Gusto). I don't like machines that use caps because they cause a lot of trash but I was okay with it because it was meant only when we get guests and I was happy to finally be able to offer coffee to my friends.

I really started to like one of the flavours though and I start drinking a mug daily pretty much. I just really hate that I cause so much plastic trash with it and would like to switch to a better machine that maybe can make a coffee straight from the beans. I still want to get something that is not too strong in coffee taste if you know what I mean (I'm new to coffee and I know this sentence might get my lynched here...).  
My favourite caps from Nescafé were the Café Au Lait and I would love to find a way to reproduce this with a normal machine. I thought maybe someone here can me help with two things:

1. Helping me a cheap/ middle class machine that could do that. It probably will need a milk tank? not sure
2. Tips on how to make a milky and sweet coffee in a machine like this. What beans? Any tips for making it?

Coffee,marshallfrost,lseali,Onyx Website/CS: the key to happiness is low expectations,"Hi everybody! Long time lurker here who attributes a lot of his coffee gains to this community's great discussion and theorycrafting.

Unfortunately my first post is curated to address an issue that sounds like some of you are relating to when I tried to find similar experiences in the sub. However, I think it's important to keep increasing awareness when CS goes wrong in hopes that they'll eventually decide to put the customer first in these areas instead of QUESTION THE CUSTOMER'S INTENTIONS.

As I think most of us know, but for anyone considering Onyx, whether one time purchase of subscription, Onyx produces a great product most of the time. With the right setup at home, the end product can be insanely fruity(speaking from trying their Africans), complex, and light but also achieving a balance on the palate. 

But their CS is absolute trash and their website/subscription service UI leaves a lot to be desired. Especially on mobile. And I think that's partially the issue.

Let me explain. And I know some of you will think this is basically user error for the most part, and I would think there's a lot of merit in that argument, but I also think Onyx's mobile website experience is DREADFUL and CONFUSING. And I build websites for a living. 

I created a subscription for their Geometry blend, 2 lbs in a monthly cycle. Apparently what happens when you create a subscription is an order is processed on the spot for that sub. This is going on memory at this point, but I don't remember any declaration that this was the case. 

So I create the subscription. I go into my account subscription and notice it says March 19th. I'm thinking, ""Hmm, well I really want the subscription to fulfill immediately, and then start monthly so let me change it to the upcoming Friday so I get my coffee early next week"" and it's Thursday at this point. The system will not warn you or say that an order based on the same subscription is already processing, are you sure you want to do this? So while I made a bone headed mistake of assuming my subscription wasn't processed as an order immediately, their website certainly isn't sophisticated enough to realize a user could be making a potential mistake by duplicating an order in a time frame of 24 hours. Learn from my dumb mistake.

Okay, now at this point I obviously have two orders for 2 lb geometry by like midnight Friday. Nothing from an email standpoint looked weird since they were duplicate order confirmations, but obviously I was oblivious to the order dates and times and didn't have any reason to believe there was a problem. Again, there's plenty of merit in just saying I'm dumb.

They fulfill both orders on that same Friday and ship them out the same day. I remember thinking it's weird that I have two different tracking numbers listed, but it hsd already shipped right? I just let it play out and I received them mid week this week. To be sure, I was surprised to receive two 2 lb bags of geometry.

Got on the horn with CS through their website (again, bad experience) to try to come to any resolution, as being 84 dollars out (instead of 42) and 4 lbs of coffee is not my idea of a good time. 

Totally unsympathetic to my plight and actually felt like I was being accused of something and why didn't I reach out sooner to resolve the issue before shipment blah, blah, blah. The duplicate order was literally processed, fulfilled, and shipped same day and obviously I wanted one of the orders. I didn't expect a refund and they didn't want to give me one anyway, but I thought it would be a gesture of good faith, due to the ambiguous process, technical limitations of the website and wanting to keep an existing customer happy, that they could ease the pain with a discount toward a future purchase. Keep in mind we're wasting plenty of time because the rep is trying to pin the situation on me to avoid actually providing good customer service. So I cut to the chase AND OFFER THE SOLUTION THE REP SHOULD BE FACILITATING. 

In the end, the rep offers a code for 10% off a future purchase. Wow, I get those in regular email feeds from Onyx. Really above and beyond and absolutely worth my time to address this issue. /s

So probably needless to say, I will definitely be laser focused if I ever order through Onyx again, subscription or no. Website leaves a lot to be desired and the CS they provide had no intention to offer a meaningful solution to any issues that may result from that cold, dead void.

The end.",1614280317

Coffee,207207,lsc68e,Differentiating between brewing technique and coffee quality,"EDIT: I should've said ""variables"" not ""technique"" in the title

I'm going through a sampler from Beanbox right now (thanks mom!) which has been really fun and exposed me to a lot of different origins, roasters, etc.  The problem is that each sample basically makes me two cups of coffee so I have one day to set a baseline and then one day to optimize.  I've started to figure out what to change in order to optimize taste (temp, ratio, time, etc) thanks to folks on here.

I've found that for some of the samples, I've made some delicious cups, whereas for others even when I think I know what I need to tweak, things just don't come out as nice as I want.  Does anyone have thoughts on how to differentiate between a roast that I just don't like/is low-quality and just not using the right mix of time/temp/ratio/grind/etc?

I'm striving for the delicious, complex wonderful flavor every time, and whereas I've gotten really close some times, I just strike out others.  Would love to hear thoughts on this.

Coffee,AfternoonMoss,lfg46z,My coffee once grounded smells... really bad,"I've got some smaller bags of specialty coffee lately stepping beyond my previous cheaper market coffee and for the past 3 of 4 bags the coffee was an absolute treat to drink. Some more sweet/chocolate, some with a distinct fruity note. Now as I got to and opened the fourth bag of a different brand... I was rather surprised.

The roasted beans have a very intensive, bit oily smell of coffee. It has been dark roasted 3 months ago according to the label. It's a Ethiopia/Brasilia/Columbia blend of Arabica, naturally processed.  
Once grounded however a strong scent of excrement or urine is present, mixed with a very faint smell of coffee.

Have the beans gone bad? Is it safe to drink? What could have caused this?",1612803407

I've got a Aeropress which I use a 30/240 inverted, a V60 on a 30/500 Hoffman method and a Moka Pot. I'm enjoying a cold brew as well, currently using a 100/500.

I have a sage barista express espresso machine and was have been having some issues with pressure. When I use the 1 cup single wall basket with the recommended grind size, grind amount and tamp pressure it works perfectly. 

When I try to use the 2 cup basket it doesn't work at all. I am using the recommended settings for the two cup basket. I have also tried using a finer grind size, higher grind amount and applying more pressure when tamping but it still doesn't work. It rarely creates even enough pressure to move the dial at all but when it does it never goes above the pre-infusion pressure.

I have tried using the 2 cup dual wall basket with the recommended settings and this too works perfectly. Can anybody help me figure out what the problem is?

Thanks

I'm currently trying to cut down on my caffeine intake without going full decaf. I've found the most cost-effective way to do this is to buy a mix of normal coffee grinds and cheaper instant decaf. I alternate between the two every day: one day regular coffee, one day instead decaf. I don't particularly love the decaf, but I haven't really hated it in the few weeks I've been doing this either.

However, today's two cups were both disgusting. I took one sip of the instant decaf, and the only way I can describe it is that the taste was overly sweet and the consistency was slimy. I actually thought that I'd perhaps forgotten to rinse some soap out of my mug, so I put the kettle on again and made another cup. It was just as gross, and I tossed it.

This is instant decaf coffee with about a spoon-and-a-half of sugar and a splash of 2% milk. Has something like this happened to anyone before? I'm not sure if the problem is the coffee, the milk (smells meh, but not gross), the sugar, or even something like the water or the kettle. Again, the stuff has been drinkable before today.",1612460862

I recently got some nice single origin beans to make pour-overs with. The bag describes the coffee as having flavors of cherries, nuts, and milk chocolate.

However, if I have the same coffee with some toast and eggs, or a peanut butter and banana sandwich, the flavor of the coffee comes ""alive"" and I can better taste the fruity and nutty notes that the bag describes.

I don't know, maybe I just have an unrefined palate. Its possible that I'm just tasting more of the food than the coffee, but I feel like there's a noticeable difference. Anyone else like to pair their coffee with food?",1612459300

I've seen advice on reddit that generally you want to grind as fine as you can until you hit a wall of bitterness. My problem is I literally can't find any bitterness no matter how fine I grind. I don't know if this is sour/bitter confusion on my part, something to do with the fact that the clever is mostly infusion, or if it's just that I'm not used to high quality coffee beans.

Coffee,IntelligentAd8855,lcerze,How Do I Avoid Sour Oat Milk with Coffee? I need an Acidity Regulator ingredient.,"How Do I Avoid Sour Oat Milk With Coffee? I need an Acidity Regulator ingredient.

So.. I generally stick to 3 different Barista Oat Milk brands to have with my espresso coffees because I have found quite a lot of the Oat Milks (even if labelled as “Barista”) turn sour when added to an espresso coffee shot. 

My 3 safe Oat Milk brands for coffee:
- Oatly Barista Oat Milk
- Calfia Barista Oat Milk
- Alternative Barista Oat Milk

I compared the ingredients of Oatly Barista Milk and another ordinary oat milk, to find the difference was an “acidity regulator”! So I’m assuming it has something to do with the acidity level of the espresso shot and when the milk is added to that, then BAM! It goes sour. 

This is so painful because I really rather not spend $5 per Oat Milk carton.. plus Oat Milk is super easy to make, super cheap and tastes great, but when added to an espresso shot.... it’s absolutely disgusting. 

So.. does anyone have any recommendations of an “Acidity Regulator” ingredient I can put into my homemade Oat Milk to avoid the sour-tasting coffee?

P.S. I’ve already tried bi-carb/baking soda and I couldn’t have tasted anything worse..",1612442398

So today, I spent a good amount of time throwing together a document that will help me (and you) track all the different variables that change from one brew to the next. It’s a printable PDF and includes a lot of data points including, but not limited to, coffee dose, water, temperature, bloom time, time between pours, results, and much more. 

Here’s a link to the doc: [Coffee Brewing Test Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uly9oTnhMTbyJgQ5BxFdAho5XqnBvO6P/view)

If the link doesn’t work for some reason, PM me and I’ll figure some other way to get it to you. 

I apologize in advance for the small text. In order to fit it all on one page, it had to be quite small. I wanted to be able to print out multiple double-sides sheets and collect them in a three-ring binder. 

Please note that when I starting building this form, it was to track my Chemex brew methods. This may or may not work for espresso, and may have to be tweaked a little to work for Aeropress. Maybe I’ll find the motivation to produce different forms for those.

Coffee,ImUntilted,lhtm4o,Is it worth it buying a cheaper hand grinder to get started?,"My situation:
I've been starting to get into the whole coffee-making thing in the last two weeks or so. At the moment I only own an electric blade grinder and a really old hand grinder that should probably belong in an antique store. I've been using the old one. It grinds quite unevenly so I thought one thing that I could improve in my set up, no matter how I brew the coffee, is the grinder. 
I know that there are very good hand grinders (like Comandante or so) that would probably satisfy all my needs but I don't know whether I'm entirely comfortable spending up to 300$ (including shipping and such) when just starting out. That's why I thought I'd get something like a Hario Slim, which seems to be a decent cheaper grinder, to start out with. Later, when I know what I need and what kind of brew I prefer and such, I could look at spending a bit more for a good hand grinder or and electric one (also: who knows? maybe in two months I'm like ""coffee brewing? no, thanks"" and then I'll have spent all that money for nothing).
From your experience, does make sense?

Coffee,_hanif,lhsynb,Exercise to Train Your Coffee Tasting (Without Drinking Coffee),"TL;DR (it's a looong one): Eat your fruits. 

I see a good number of people on this sub asking questions like, ""How do I learn to describe tasting notes?"" or even before that, ""How do I learn to taste tasting notes?""

I've seen lots of solid advice, like ""Do side-by-side comparisons,"" ""Try cupping,"" etc. Very good ideas and well worth your time, especially for the initial process of learning to distinguish one coffee from another. However, there came a time when I could easily tell two different coffees apart but still was no nearer to applying the type of exotic labels (pineapple! caramel!) that they throw on the side of bags. 

To develop this really niche and unnecessary (but cool) skill, I was led through a series of exercises designed to connect the physical sensation of a flavor to the mental response of a description; this type of exercise, done properly, ensures that you form the ""correct"" connections, ""correct"" meaning by the SCAA and CQI standards (not to deify ""the man"" like that, but it does help to have a standardized language so one person’s baking chocolate isn't another’s blood orange). 

In another age, you could go to SCAA Skills Building workshops and pay to get your hands dirty with the pros and their pro equipment like Le Nez du Café, a box of 36 bottled aromas that appear in coffee. Now you can’t, and you definitely don’t want to drop $300 on a box of liquid smells, but fortunately you can replicate the essence of the exercises at home. It can be tough without a teacher to pummel with questions, but here’s an exercise you can try that’s meant to open your understanding of the Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel, the magical hoop from which all the fun words are derived (see below). You don’t even need to buy any fancy coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

[Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel; or, The Magical Hoop, Root of All Pretension \(source: SCAA\)](https://preview.redd.it/4jotpoiahwg61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf2f2965e0527e75abccebe61d18aad0988d8c87)

1.  Go to the super market. Here’s your shopping list:

· 1 papaya (all these fruits can be whole or pre-cut. I recommend whole for maximum freshness and minimum salmonella)

· 1 mango

· 1 yellow banana

· 1 red banana

· 1 each of Red Delicious, Pink Lady, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, and Fuji apples (that’s 5 apples)

· 1 pink grapefruit

· 1 lime

· 1 normal orange (sweet or Valencia or navel, doesn’t really matter)

· 1 blood orange

· 1 lemon

· More than 1 blackberry

· Raspberries

· Strawberries

· Blueberries

· 1 or more dark chocolate bars (≥65% cacao)

· 1 small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips

· 1 Hershey’s milk chocolate bar

· A bag of mixed nuts with almonds, hazelnut, walnut, etc. (skip this if you’re allergic)

2.  Cut up the fruits and lay out all your foods in groups: the tropicals together, the apples together, the citrus, the berries, the chocolates, the nuts. You can set out toothpicks and cocktail napkins if you’re feeling dainty. Smell everything. Focus on the smells. This smorgasbord is your makeshift Le Nez du Café. 

3.  At this point I hope you’re not keto cause you’re about to house all this food. Each group will serve as an exercise for a different element of coffee tasting, and can be tackled in any order. Descriptions of each activity and my recommendation for order is as follows:

a.  **Malic Acidity with Apples**: Taste each variety of apple and **rank them from least to greatest in “intensity of acidity.”**Intensity of acidity is the strength or presence of both sweet and tart acids in a flavor. Though you are focusing on acidity, take note of the distinct flavor of each apple. Here I must emphasize the distinction between *eating* and *tasting*. Same physical actions, but in tasting you must be highly focused on the *sensation of flavor.* For you meditators, this is one of the finest real-world applications of meditative awareness. You must direct *all* your focus on the flavor you are tasting. Flavor is a fleeting thing, and early on, without full awareness, I found myself missing it entirely. Try, but if you miss it at first, try again. Train yourself to get “in the zone;” it becomes essential in cupping where things move fairly quickly.

b.  **Citric Acidity with Citrus Fruits**: **Rank the citrus fruits from least to greatest in intensity of acidity**. The difference between this type of acidity and the sweeter, malic acidity of apples is very apparent in the fruits themselves, but is tougher to distinguish in the context of coffee. Noting the unique flavors of each citrus fruit and comparing them with the flavors of the apples will help prepare you to detect, and more importantly distinguish, malic and citric acids in a cup of coffee. The citrus fruits are also helpful because they appear on the Flavor Wheel (tasting note words). I know you know what an orange tastes like. But you need to *really* know. This exercise combined with proper awareness trains your ability to mentally conjure the exact sensation of “tasting an orange,” which you can then detect in a cup of coffee.

c.  **Body with Tropical Fruits**: Taste each tropical fruit, **ranking them from least to greatest in “body.”** Body is the sensation of weight or thickness in the mouth, determined mostly by lipid (fat) content, and is a major factor in evaluating coffee. Compare each fruit to milk. Which has a thickness like skim milk, which like whole, and which like heavy cream? Again, while you’re focusing primarily on body, spend some time really tasting the flavor of these fruits; they show up on the Flavor Wheel and their sensations should be memorized. You can also focus on “mouthfeel,” the texture of the fruits. Are they creamy, chalky, silky? Something else?

d.  **Layered Flavor with Berries**: This one is challenging. Tasting each berry, focus as intensely as you can on its flavor and try to go beyond your pre-conceived “blackberry” or “raspberry” answer as your verbal response. What else is there in the flavor of a raspberry? Chocolate? Herbs? Flowers? Nuts? See what you can find when you really look. You may also choose to rank the berries by intensity of acidity, body, or even how complex you find their flavors (by how complex, I mean how many other flavors you can detect that constitute the entire flavor). Berry flavors are an essential part of the Flavor Wheel. Become extremely familiar with the sensation of tasting each berry.

e.  **Bitterness with Chocolate**: Melt a piece of each chocolate on your tongue. Focus on everything discussed above (flavor, body, acidity) as well as bitterness, and notice how the level bitterness changes with the type of chocolate. Decide which levels of bitterness are most pleasant to you. Also focus on the lingering sensation in the mouth after eating chocolate. This sensation becomes important when trying to identify chocolate notes in a coffee.

f.  **Flavor with Nuts**: With the nuts, mostly the same deal. Focus on their flavor. Know an almond from a peanut from a hazelnut on a deep level. They all appear on the Flavor Wheel.

Thus concludes the exercise. Write your rankings and thoughts down as you go. Be confident in them but do not be afraid to be wrong; the ability to rank fruits based on certain qualities is not natural or instinctual in the human. You’re not made to be good at it. It must be trained.

Now you may ask: how do I effectively apply this to coffee tasting? Coffee is evaluated on its aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, and body, all very jargonized ideas to which your brain can only prescribe “sensational” definitions to through experience. Now that you have experience 

Remember the berries, and how you focused on moving beyond the pre-conceived notion of “xberry.” This is what a roaster or cupper is doing when they ascribe tasting notes to a coffee. Coffee with blueberry notes isn’t going to taste like a blueberry smoothie; coffee is always gonna taste like coffee. They get “blueberry” because they have trained their brain to be so familiar with the sensation of tasting blueberry that they can also get that sensation from things that are not blueberries but carry some similarities. Finding tasting notes in coffee is much like the instinctual phenomenon of finding “faces” in things that don’t really have faces, like a wall outlet. Our brain *knows* faces, and a cupper’s brain *knows* flavors in the same way. 

A good way to practice with coffee is to look at the Flavor Wheel while tasting. Start general, like in a game of 20 Questions. Are you sensing Chocolates, Fruits, Spices, or Something Bad? Ok, fruit. Is it tropical, citrus, berry? And so on. You don’t need to land on a specific food in the beginning. “This coffee is chocolatey and fruity” is a fine step from, “This is coffee.” Let, ""This coffee has the aroma of brown sugar and strong notes of almond and vanilla,"" come later.

[Here is an ""answer key"" to the rankings of the fruits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaMnA0OAc1qdMyUuvJHr_WMjhkxu_xOq/view?usp=sharing). Don’t look at it until you’ve done the exercise, please. When training the senses, it’s so important to rely on the senses alone. It is very easy for suggestion and bias to get in the way and limit your learning. 

Hope you enjoy, and let me know if you tried it. Keep learning and keep drinking coffee.",1613072987
Coffee,jstati,lhsk0p,Descaling with citric acid,"I have a small Bodum electric water kettle that I use when heating water for french press or aero press.

Setup specs:
Gaggia Classic Pro
 - 9 bar pressure spring 
 - Brass shower holder
 - IMS Shower head 
 - IMS Portafilter Basket 
58.4mm Tamper 
Compak E5 Grinder 

I’ve watched many videos to make sure my tamp is even and consistent and the grounds are evenly distributed. 

I can make perfect espresso’s all day long at my parents house with a different setup (given it is way nicer than mine and probably more forgiving). I’m trying to figure out how to get a well extracted pull without dropping $1k-4k on a nicer machine. 

I get coffee from a local 3rd wave roaster and usually finish the bag within 3-4 weeks of roast date. 

Things I’ve noticed:
- If I grind coarser then it doesn’t channel but predictably it brews too quickly. The espresso is thin with little to no crema. Tastes under-extracted and bitter. 

- If I grind finer then it brews longer but always channels. Looking at the puck there are always 1-3 pinhole channels. With the finer grind then the grounds look almost ‘mushy’ on the top which I have only ever encountered on this machine.  It tastes alright but I know that there is more potential there. 

In my experiences with my parents machine if the grind is too fine then it comes out way too slow and tastes sour. I’ve never managed that with my home setup. Even with the grinder on its finest setting. It’ll just channel and pull 2oz in 15 seconds. 

- I’ve tried adjusting the firmness of tamp which doesn’t seem to make too much difference. 

-I started using the steamer knob to lower the pressure to mock ‘pre-infusion’ which helped quite a lot but hasn’t solved the problem. 

I find it strange that I have never had channeling issues with the other machines I’ve used but with my home setup I have I can’t seem to avoid it. The only mod for the Gaggia I haven’t gotten is the PID kit but I’m not sure that’ll fix the situation.

I thank anyone who has made it this far in my narrative! The question I’m asking is: Am I missing something or doing something wrong? Are my expectations just too high for the equipment I have?",1613065113

Coffee,CoffeeAll01,lhl8r4,How to make smooth and rich Arabic or Turkish coffee,"We’re going to to learn how to make Arabic or Turkish coffee with a couple of helpful tips on how to get it smooth and rich.

We’re going to need a coffee pot or an ibrik. We’re also going to need fresh cold water and Arabic coffee grounds. 

First, we’re going to fill the ibrik with the fresh cold water about half way and then we’re going to bring the water to a boil on our stovetop. Once the water starts boiling we’re going to turn off the heat and go and grab our Arabic coffee grounds from the fridge. It’s important once we open the package of pre-ground Arabic coffee we place them in a jar in the fridge to maintain its freshness. Now we’re going to put the right amount of coffee grounds in the ibrik. Here we’re going to put one heaping table spoon for about one cup and a half of water. Tip 1: For this we’re going to tap the coffee grounds in the water, not stir, to macerate them in the water. It should take about four taps, don’t over do it. The reason for this is to lightly macerate the coffee grounds with the hot water so they can later foam up for the next step. Tip 2: Once we’ve done that then we’re going to reheat the water with a medium low to medium heat. For this step it’s counter intuitive, you might think in order to get the coffee to taste smooth we should put it on low heat to prevent the coffee from over cooking and tasting bitter but in actuality it cooks the coffee for a longer period of time therefore, coming out bitter. Putting the fire on medium low to medium is going to speed up the brewing process plus it’s going to make the coffee come out smooth tasting. Now when the coffee starts to rise, lower down the heat to low to prevent the coffee from overflowing and let it gently rise regulating the heat according to the rising of the coffee. Then we’re going to keep the fire under the coffee until it settles and after settling keep the fire on low for about five seconds before turning off the heat.

Serve using a Demitasse. And there we have it smooth and rich Arabic or Turkish coffee ready to drink. Enjoy.",1613052090

Coffee,fichoman,lhkwz3,"Well, it's gone boys, it's gone and I don't think I can bring it back","Tl,dr: Accidentally had the perfect grind size, after messing with my grinder I can't get any fruitiness from my Ethiopia natural, I've been trying for days now and I'm lost 


Always loved the taste of coffee, pure, unadulterated coffee, but for many reasons I couldn't drink it for a couple of years so I switched to tea, and let me tell you I love tea, but it's not coffee, and you can't really drink that much per day without geting weirdly but intensely and uncomfortably high on caffeine+L-theanine,  
anyway,  
Recently got into specialty coffee, I was really excited, got myself a grinder (it's an old handmade turkish metal burr grinder, it's hard to disassemble, it's so heavy you can kill a fully grown horse with it and even one cup of coffee is a workout, but it grinds so uniform it's ridicolous)  
So at first i thought you can't modulate grind size, so i just put some Ethiopia natural coffee beans inside and ground it to basically a turkish grind, but you could still feel the grinds between your fingers, it wasnt dusty,  
I made a pour over with it, it worked,  
It was so good, it tasted like white chocolate, strawberries and everything that coffee can be,  
I was ecstatic,  
It reminded me of the first time i tried an IPA, that mixture of pleasant bitterness and unbelievable fruitiness, it really was that intense,  
I made another cup, immersion this time, got the same result, 
    
.  
But than i got to dismantling the grinder and cleaning it, in the process I noticed there is a screw for modulating grind size, i released it to clean it better and, after putting it all back together, tried experimenting with coarser grinds,  
Didn't really work...  
So I tightened it back and tried again,  
Nothing,  
No bitterness, no sourness, amazing coffee, just absolutely fruitless,  
  
It's been three days now, I have consumed, and spilled, God knows how much coffee and not once got anything other than ""mildly fruity but only if you really focus""  
  
I'm at a loss, i wake up every day hoping this will be the day, but i just can't get it to work,  
I just want to try so many coffees, i got a half kilo of unroasted Sumatra gayo and I'm even eyeing a bag of Columbian experimental lacto-fermented natural/honey process heat shock beans whith a taste profile worthy of the gods,  
  
But what's the point if I can't figure out why my cups are so uninteresting,

Coffee,siderealseraph,lhce56,[question] what are my upgrade options from a cheap drip pot of Bustello?,"disclaimer: I know very little about coffee

what I know: my lady drinks a small cup of café bustello with a healthy serving of preheated half&amp;half or milk, probably a whole cup measure of grounds (she goes through a *lot* of coffee), and brown sugar every morning. it's cheap, quick, and easy. she strongly dislikes how watery most fast food coffee tastes.

what are good options to consider upgrading from here? I can only assume this is the starting point in the world of coffee making.

we're open to learning new methods of brewing. knowing her taste, I'm thinking of trying a stronger type/brand of coffee, a grinder, or a new machine that she'll still be able to control the concentration of coffee to water. 

any advice is appreciated.",1613016072
Coffee,rabidsoggymoose,lhc0lf,Cafflano Kompresso has some serious design problems?,"I've been experimenting with the Kompresso and there are a couple of things that concern me. I'm not sure how much these things will affect extraction, but the possibility is maybe theoretically there? I'd like some input from Kompresso users.

1. The tamper is trash. The tamper is the bottom of the scoop and the diameter isn't even flush with the portafilter basket, so when you tamp down there are still grinds all up along the walls of the portafilter. Plus the Cafflano logo is printed on the bottom and leaves an imprint in the coffee, which means the tamp can never be completely even, by design.

2. The portafilter's bottom screen is a thin piece of pressed steel. The middle of it bows outwards with pressure and now it stays a bit bowed out in the middle. You can press on it and it will flex back and forth. 

This means the center column of coffee is always going to be a bit thicker than at the edges due to the concave bowed shape, and when I press down the first bits of extraction *always* start coming out from the outside edge of the screen and dripping from the middle of the screen only arrives some time later. So the flimsiness of the portafilter screen seems to guarantee more extraction of the grinds at the outside perimeter than the middle. 

Why they chose to use a flimsy flexible screen rather than a plate or thicker material is beyond me. None of the portable hand-pumped machines have this property. It would not add much more weight.

Points the Onyx person makes:  Filling V60 to top, e.g. Hoffmann one pour method, does two bad thing:  1) pushes water out sides of filter and 2) pushes ground bed into the V60 dripper channels, leading to clogging the brew.  Also, he makes a point that during prewetting of the filter, lift the filter up after wetting it to make sure it did not fold around the dripper spiral channels.

Coffee,Semper_0FP,lh27jj,What I learned today: You do not need to use 30g of coarsely ground coffee to obtain a good cup from an Aeropress.,"I've had my fair share of frustrations trying to get a good cup out of my Aeropress using medium roasts. Some advice I saw was to use the Aeropress competition winner recipes, but halve the dose from 30g to 15g and grind slightly finer.

For the competition brew I used a setting of 26 on my Baratza Encore grinder. It's just a tad shy of french press coarseness. For the halved dose, I tried 20-22 and got horrid results.

The past two days I've done the following as I've noticed a coarse grind really helps in the Aeropress. The result is a nicely balanced cup on the chocolatey side. It could use a tad more flavor strength but I am still playing around with that. Not sure if that's from diluting at the end or if it needs a few more seconds brewing.

Brewer: Aeropress with Fellow Prismo Attachment. I do not invert.

Filter: Fellow Prismo metal filter and a washed Aeropress filter

Grinder: Baratza Encore on setting 26. This is maybe 3-4 clicks shy of french press coarseness.

Beans: Something medium, 18g

Pro-tip here: I bought a flour strainer on Amazon to strain my grind. I find my Encore leaves some fine dust even in a coarse grind. I dump my grind onto the flour strainer over the sink and sift for about 20-30 seconds. I found this removed an entire gram of weight today. What's left is a fairly consistent grind with a small percentage being a bit smaller than the rest.

Water: Boiled from the tap. I live in Seattle and have soft water. I let the temp drop down to ~200F. Yesterday I got a stronger cup when I poured it in at 202F, today I went in at 198F and got a slightly less tasty cup.

I bloom for about 15-30 seconds with 40-50ml of water I don't really know if this is necessary. I also stir it a tad to make sure everything is wet. By 30 seconds, I pour up until 150ml of water making sure to get everything saturated with water. I stir up until the point where the beans aren't clumped together anymore and are suspended in the water. At 1:20 to 1:30, I plunge for 40-60 seconds. I've been plunging at the 1:20 mark normally but perhaps another 10 seconds might be better. 

Then dilute with 50-100ml of water, your preference here. I did 80ml and found it mild but still tasty. 60 or 70ml might be more bold.

The cup I'm getting has zero bitterness or sourness. It's a flavorful, sweet cup. Almost like a slightly weaker french press without it seeming too watery.",1612986949

I’ve used many different types of specialty roasters, different recipes, grinds, etc. in order to dial in a good or even great cup of coffee every morning. I can honestly say that the V60 is a great pour over dripper. One of the best.

I recently received my Origami Dripper and after a few brews with a few different coffees, recipes, grinds, etc. I have it dialed in just as I like it. And I must say...I’m getting better all around tasting brews with the Origami.

Now I know this is just my opinion and is different for everyone. But personally I am finding my coffee in the Origami more flavorful and so damn appealing to look at every morning as the esthetic is just so beautiful. I can really taste more of the subtle flavor notes labeled on each bag of coffee much easier with Origami.

So I’m not really sure if one is truly better than the other as I like both a lot for pour over brews. But I will just say for the time being the Origami has won me over. Cheers ☕️",1612977291

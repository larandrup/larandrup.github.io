Coffee,imfromg00gle,lojct4,Broken Breville Barista Express?,"Hey guys!

(I posted this on r/espresso as well but I thought I might as well get help here as well)

I happened to snatch a good deal on a BBE earlier today and even though I haven't received the item yet, I was wondering if there is anything I can do to prepare myself for its eventual arrival. The seller mentioned they bought it second hand and it's in really good condition, with the box, accessories, and everything (I have pictures). When it's plugged in the lights turn on like normal but, they never flash to indicate that it's ready, thus having a warmed-up machine that apparently cant grind, steam or pull. The seller said, they tried cleaning the grinder but that's about it, they weren't comfortable enough to open and mess with the inside. I'm planning to take it to a local repair shop but if you guys have any idea of what it could be it would be extremely helpful!

Edit: This is my first Breville product so I'm not an expert. But I'm thinking it has something to do with cleaning? if everything turns on and warms up, what could possibly be happening to make it lock up?",1613862994

Coffee,Cobboolio,loj4jf,What makes bad coffee beans so bad?,"Have just recently got a grinder and some beans. Ran out  of beans and a local deli shop sells cheap coffee beans (£2 for 250g), so thought I would try it. The beans just  smelled odd, and the brewed coffee actually made me feel a bit nauseous and tasted awful, like ashy and really dark.

What the hell was that coffee, and why was it so bad? It was labeled as ""Migro Coffee"" in a plastic bag. My first guess would be they were really burnt? Is there anything else that could make beans taste awful?",1613862321
Coffee,dgmischief,loiwfx,Coffee for 6-12 people? Can anyone suggest a 2 Liter or larger french press?,"Super grateful for this sub. I went from kind of knowing how to do pourovers to ""the coffee guy"". I've invested in an espresso machine(Astra Pro) and a Niche. Unfortunately, it's still not a great time to host so my workaround has been to buy a 2L carafe and bring it to work gatherings and that sort of thing.

I'm wondering if people have suggestions for the best way to brew? I have an 8 cup Chemex which worked okay, but really only does around a liter and it's a pretty significant hassle especially if I haven't had coffee yet 😂. I've tried just dumping grounds into a 2L mason jar and pouring water over it. I then filter it through a coffee sock which makes some really good stuff but again I have to brew in two batches.

My thought is to buy a 2.5L french press which would have just enough capacity to make a 2L final batch. But honestly, I can't really seem to find one. I don't mind dropping a significant amount of money, I just want to make sure I'm buying something that will check all the boxes.",1613861699
Coffee,Super_Nintend0,lohgqe,Dialing in my Breville Barista Pro - Having some Trouble,"So I finally caught the bug, the daily desire to fill my house with that nutty, earthy aroma of fresh coffee and build my own barista skill set. This was an easy choice once I calculated how much I was spending at Starbucks, without even being particularly a fan of their coffee (they have such accessible parking). 

So I got Breville Barista Pro and am having a hell of a time pulling a decent double shot. 

I’ll start with where I wound up:

Best tasting shot: grind size - 5, dose - 15g, pour time, 18s. But no crema or body. 

Best looking shot: grind size - 4 (after stepping down the conical grinder internally), dose - 17g, pour time 25s. Nice honey/caramel color and good crema/body. Was too bitter. 

So now I’ve gone through a pound of coffee ( Kimbo Extra Cream )and a page and a half of experiment notes and still can’t quite get there. I basically ground it finer and finer playing with dose until I over extracted (33s) and then backed it out. 

Can someone please help me get over the hump and into flavor country?",1613857372
Coffee,Acavia8,logi3k,Acidity of coffee - enhance by not-brew water but water you normally drink.,"My brews are normally similar depending on parameters - grind size, water temperature, ratios etc.  Recently I lost power for several days. During that time, I drank stored well water, that was collected before my water softener, so it was hard water.  Since regaining power, I brewed coffee again, with Third Wave Water that I normally use - note: I never made coffee with my well water.

The coffee was extremely acidic tasting - it tasted like a strong acid drink, almost to extent like I was drinking a glass of white vinegar or something.  Each day, it got lighter tasting, even though same brew, and today's, the third, was still acidic tasting but closer to how I remember it.  The only thing I can think to explain it is that for several days I was drinking hard ground water, and my tastes became more accustomed to high mineral water, highlighting the contrast in the acidic taste in coffee.

Thoughts?",1613854565
Coffee,DJRoombaLives,lofuzm,10 year old Capresso Infinity grinder: replace burrs or replace whole thing?,"I’ve been using a Capresso Infinity grinder for 10-11 years. It’s the only burr grinder I’ve ever owned, and it’s been a very reliable machine. I’ve only done a deep clean on it a couple of times to get rid of oil build up. My only complaint about it is how removing the cup from the grinder always ends up flinging some grounds onto the counter.

My question is this: should I consider replacing the burrs at this point? Or have grinders improved enough in the last decade that I’d be happier getting something new? I remember the Infinity being a well-reviewed model back in 2010, but I don’t see it brought up in this subreddit at all. It looks like the same model is still available to purchase, so I figure that means it’s still at least somewhat popular.

Coffee,jxnfpm,lob35v,Looking for cold brew advice for my NitroBrew kit,"I bought myself a NitroBrew kit for my birthday because I love Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew, which I love.  I also drink \*waaay\* too much coffee, so the vast majority of coffee I brew at home is decaf.

The only real great cold brew I've been able to make with decaf beans is using the Starbucks Verona Decaf that semi-regularly goes on a sale for a decent price at my Publix.  The NitroBrew kit does a great job of making that taste pretty similar to the caffeinated Nitro Cold Brew that Starbucks sells.

Now that I have the NitroBrew, I've tried to up my cold brew coffee game by buying a Hario Mizudashi cold brew pot (which I really like), and I just ordered a burr coffee grinder with the intention of shifting from buying ground coffee to coffee beans.

Does anyone have any good advice that would help me make better cold brew for nitro cold brews at home?  I'm happy with what I'm making as a baseline, but I'm sure there are ways to up my game.

1) when grinding, beans spit up out of the grinder part into the hopper, and it seems like there’s always one or two that don’t make their way into the burr and rattle around until i stop the grind, let them sink, then give it a short burst. Is this normal? 

2) the hopper itself seems to slightly vibrate and move a bit while the machine is on. Is that normal? 


Now more specific questions about brewing with. Pour over. I have a Boudum pour over, which i guess is kind of like a knockoff Chemex. I’ve tried grinding at a 20, 15, and 12 now, but I just can’t get the taste right. I’ve been doing 25G of coffee to 350g of water for a 1:14 ratio. It always tastes a too watered down. I’ll also mention that I’m using the mesh reusable filter that came with the pour over about 3 years ago. It’s not damaged or anything but I’m just throwing in all the variables for your information. 

I used 12 on the Encore for aero press and it was absolutely delicious. Definitely got hints and flavors from the coffee I’ve never tasted before, so I see the Baratza light, I’m just trying to get the proper settings dialed in for the pour over. The batches I’ve made in the boudum are nowhere near as delicious as from the aero press.

Please comment on my current method and make suggestions.,"I typically have around 10-15 minutes in the morning to make myself a nice cup of coffee in the morning before work. So what I have been doing over the last 5 years or so is I have a Capresso Grinder with 12 different fineness settings I use to do a ""mid-medium"" fineness grinding of the whole beans (If level 1 is ultra fine and level 12 is super coarse I have it set to level 8) I'm super I'm doing this part wrong but had no idea after trial and error over the years. The grindings look similar in size to those I see when I cut open a store bought sealed keurig pod.

I pour whole beans (lately been buying bones coffee) into the grinder from a sealed bag I store in a cabinet. I then fill a custom K-cup adapter pod up to around the 3/4th full mark with the grindings, set the keurig to a 14oz size, and brew the coffee directly into my mug or thermos. When I use a thermos it's typically too hot to drink on the way to work so I have to use a small ice cube to cool it down some. 

When I'm at home drinking from the mug it's the perfect temperature. I find the flavor to be pretty acceptable BUT I feel like I could be making myself a better cup of coffee. Do you have any suggestions for how I could change my methods around a bit to make a better cup of coffee in the morning and please explain why if you would be so kind.

I have a pretty niche question and could really use someone's help in translating/explaining what I have in my hands. 

I have a coffee tasting report from the Cafetalera Internacional Cafinter S.A. that I want to extract some extra info out of. I've already translated most of it using google, but there's some stuff that google translate and the dictionary only translates literally and could use a Spanish speakers help with the intended meanings. 

I also have a spider graph and a bar chart that has some very limited industry info that I don't understand at all without context. Any hints as to what it means so I can research it more on my own would be greatly appreciated as I've hit a dead end on my own. 

A little background about the coffee: they are Costa Rican Valle Occidental beans grown between 350-400m elevation.

Coffee,didsomeonesaydonuts,lni5wu,Looking for suggestions on moving up from my Breville XL870.,"I’ve been using my 870 for about 3 years now. Over all very pleased with it as well as with the built in grinder. It’s pretty dialed in and only needs the occasional tweak. As for use I’m the only one that uses it and I typically pull between 2-4 shots a day. The main reasons I’m looking to move up is because of how loud the pump recharge is and how slow the steam wand is to start up. What I do like about this machine is it’s size (it just about fits under my cabinets) as well as how fast it is to start up from off and that it can be used, a bit awkwardly, one handed (when I’m holding our baby). 

I’m usually pulling my first shot around 5am when everyone is still sleeping and at times it wakes up my youngest and middle child. It is one floor down but the noise travels. Not sure if this level of noise is common on all machines or just especially loud on this one. I did have it checked and serviced by breville last year and it came back as operating as it should. 

As for budget for a new machine and grinder I’d like to stay below $1500 in total.

Coffee,ObjRenFaire,lnhdk3,Our coffee maker exploded spectacularly this morning; replacement suggestions?,"Hello coffee enthusiasts!

So our trusty Hamilton Beach 12-cup Brewstation that has been limping along for the six months we've been offhandedly saying to one another, ""You know, it's leaking more and more, we really should look at replacing it"" finally decided to retire to that big coffee shop in the sky this morning. According to my partner, a spring went flying just after he poured his work mug and coffee drenched the countertop and my dreams of having a second cup this morning. 


He wants to try fixing it first, bless his pack-bonded little soul, but barring that I'd like to have a replacement unit picked out and on standby to soothe the bitter taste of failure (and our caffeine withdrawal migraines). 


I think we'd like to avoid getting this model again. It's barely three years old and has been leaking for during every use for a sixth of its lifetime, but we need something that holds a significant amount of coffee. We certainly don't mind a carafe though our current maker is without one. 


I turn to you, most cultured of coffee connoisseurs, benevolent brew masters, purveyors of pep, and understanding audience of all good things in this world. What are your suggestions at prices of up to, let's say, around $200 USD? 


I appreciate your time and attention in this. I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the choices available, and really need opinions outside of reviews.",1613745535

Coffee,kageryu42,lnf9t4,Giannina Moka Pot and 1Zpresso JX-Pro Hand Grinder Quesitons,"Hi,
Recently, I've been thinking about stepping up my coffee game.  Right now I either drink black coffee brewed in a traditional coffee pot or coffee with just a little creamer.  I have a sweet tooth and sometimes can't help myself when it comes to the flavored creamers.  I hope this isn't a coffee taboo.

Anyway, instead of buying an expensive expresso machine, I thought about trying out a moka pot and good grinder.  I think I really like the Giannina 6 cup moka pot and the 1Zpresso JX-Pro.  However, I would like to read any of your comments about this setup before I pull the trigger.  I know I could get a far cheaper moka pot, but I really like the look, the finish and the features of the Giannina moka pots.  Especially the fact that the 6 cup model is really a 6 or 3 cup model.

I would also be interested in knowing what setting on the 1Zpresso JX-Pro would be good for the moka pot and how many grams or ounces I should grind for the 6 cup moka pot.  I'm guessing whatever number I get, I can half when I use the reducer for 3 cups.

Thanks,

Coffee,rafalidzkowski,lndi5a,Coffee setup recommendations,"Hi there,
Right now I’m looking for some guidance and opinions on choosing my next coffee setup. 

Currently I’m drinking mostly drip coffee from Gabi Master A and from V60. 
My setup contains Gaggia Classic, Wilfa Svart grinder, Hario electric kettle, V60, Aeropress, Prismo, Gabi Master A and few others. 

I would like to up my pour over game and choose right setup for me. 

I’m planning on getting 3 new grinders(drip, espresso and work/travel), drip coffee machine, and some kind of espresso setup. 



Grinder options:
- Wilfa Uniform - good, inexpensive and for single dosing 
- Baratza Forte - very good for drip, not ideal for single dosing 
- Niche Zero - good for espresso and single dosing 
- Gina Arco - this one I could use for home and travel. Easy single dosing and grind size adjustment. I’ve already bought one for my brother 
- Eureka Atom 75 - great espresso grinder but not ideal for singles dosing 
- Comandante with electric kit - electric kit is &gt;3x expensive than the grinder... but from what I’ve heard it should produce great results. It’s harder to adjust grind size 
- 1Zpresso JX PRO - inexpensive and good for travel 


Coffee machines
- Moccamaster
- Ratio Six
- Sage Precision Brewer - I don’t like the look of it 

Espresso 
- Cafelat Robot - easy workflow, no need for preheating, easy cleaning

Coffee,Fuzzy_Personality,lnbzyj,Looking for help with my moka pot.,"I've been using my G.A.T. 2 tc aluminum moka pot for almost a year now. It worked just fine but recently it has started splattering in the middle of the brew. The coffee flows smoothly until it reaches the middle of the pot, then it suddenly starts splattering. At this point there's still almost a half of water in the lower chamber, but it doesn't want to flow, the pot just keeps spitting it out violently. The thing is, if I remove the pot from the stove, let it cool down, and then bring it back on the stove, the rest of the water starts flowing evenly again. I thought it might be because the temperature was too high, but lowering the heat didn't change anything. Even on the lowest heat it behaves just the same. Does anybody have any thought why this happens and how to fix it?",1613727697

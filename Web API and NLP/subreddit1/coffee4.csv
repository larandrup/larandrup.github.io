In short, several hours after drinking any coffee beverage, I end up with a bad snot-like metallic taste in my mouth that often lingers into the next day. It'll happen whether I drink the coffee black, with oat/almond/regular milk, or in a latte. I rarely drink coffee on an empty stomach and drink a decent amount of water throughout the day. I've tried drinking coffee from a few different shops, and the results are always the same. Black tea doesn't create the same negative reaction, so I don't think caffeine is the issue.

Coffee,LutheBeard,lqhroc,"Repair of broken paddlewheel on Krups EA9000 or: How to repair 1200,- bucks coffee machine with cable ties","I wanted to share my experience with you from repairing a Krups EA9000. So my father bought this machine a few years back and enjoyed it ever since, but since a few months he had a problem with the grinder. He tried to open it up and fix it, but never managed to get to the root of the problem. So the last time I visited him I have seen this machine outside, he told me he wanted to throw it out so I decided to give it a try.

I have to confess, I never was a big coffee drinker (I know, wrong sub and so on, but still this experience could be helpful to some of you). Still, since I like to tinker with machines, I decided to take the machine and take it apart to maybe find the root of the problem. After many hours of trying to disassemble the machine, I finally reached the grinder and decided to also dismantle this one. And here I realized the problem, a good summary of a similar problem you can also find in [this](https://www.epiphanydigest.com/2016/10/03/baratza-rescues-starbucks-grinder/) post. Since I did not have a 3D printer by hand and wanted to fix it right away, I decided to go with a little macgyver solution (as seen in the picture). And after putting it back in (multiple times in the wrong direction) it really worked! Since the paddlewheel really just has the job to push out the coffee, this apparently can be done by cable ties. It may not be the optimal solution and you can easily print this paddle wheel with a 3D printer or order it at some company, but for me it is enough for now :D

So in general what I wanted to share with this post: Do not give up your equipment because of some mysterious watery coffee! Maybe you have to bring it to someone familiar with machines/repairing (there is a torque limiter inside and some other sensible equipment), but you do not have to throw it out!

Hopefully my experience with this can help some other people to find the courage to repair their coffee machine.

I have been looking at the Baratza Encore (mod possible to make finer grinds), the Sette 30, and the Sette 270.

Coffee,TheTrueForte,lq21m0,Chasing the Flavor from an unlikely place,"Hi, im a relatively broke college student who is trying to make the best cup of coffee possible, but I need help finding a similar tasting coffee blend to one that many of you may have tried. I have recently been exploring different types of coffee roasts, and originally I was drawn towards darker roasts like Kirklands Colombian Supremo Bean Dark Roast. 

However, one day I was in a pinch and needed to get coffee on the go so I decided to stop by 7-11 and look for a similar blend to what I normally get. The choice I went with was the Colombian Medium Roast and I was surprised to find that the coffee had a bit of a fruity taste. Prior to this I had never known that coffee could have a fruity taste and I was honestly confused as to if I was imagining the flavor or if it was a side effect of buying a cheap $1.50 cup of coffee from 7-11. After researching further, I found you guys and this community and realized that there is so much to flavor that I don't know about. My question for you guys is if anyone knows of a good roast to try that can give me a similar fruity flavor in my coffee to the fruity 7-11 blend I tried. I keep craving this fruity flavor whenever I drink the remainder of my 3 month old stale Maxwell house coffee and would love any help towards buying a good, fruity blend. I cant afford to buy multiple brands at the moment to experiment so a nudge in the right direction would be huge for me.

So far I've only used dunkin' donut k cups with 8oz of water to make a cup and I've enjoyed it and started to appreciate coffee and started looking in into ground coffee and maybe grinding my own beans down the road. 

Last night I bought a bag of WAWA ground coffee and a pack of WAWA K-cups as well. Since I have a reusable cup for the Keurig I can use the ground coffee there but the instructions of the ground coffee bag say 1 TBSP of coffee with 6oz water = 1 cup. The WAWA k-cups I have has 2 TBSP of coffee in it which is the same size my reusable K cup can use and goes with 6oz as well. So my questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. does the ground coffee contain more caffeine in it for it to only say 1 TBSP when the same brand k-cup has 2 TBSP recommended with the same amount of water? Or would 2 TBSP of ground equal about the same as a k-cup?
2. If I put 2TBSP of ground coffee in the reusable cup should I do 12oz of water?
3. Is there anyway to tell how much caffeine I am getting from wawa ground coffee so I can monitor my caffeine intake? Like how much caffeine would be in 1 TBSP of ground? I did a quick google search and first result is like 180mg of caffeine which seems high for 1 TBSP when I also read the that k-cups range from 80-140.

Idk, I'm just confused is all about the amount of ground I should use and the amount of caffeine I should expect since I'd like to stay within a healthy daily range of caffeine intake.",1614028242

Is there anything I should know before purchasing one? Or is there another model I should consider? I'd like to get one for under $800 (including a grinder) that will last a while.

Thanks in advance:)",1614021978

Coffee,Tanmay2699,lpw7fz,Roasted Coffee in High Humidity and High Temperature,"To start off, I am not that experienced in the Coffee World so I didn't notice or cared before. In my Country, it's Feburary and we're already experiencing a temprature of almost 30°C in the day. Drops about 15 by the night. We experience a summer of intense heat where temprature sores above 42-45°C sometimes and a normal humidity level is 28%

I was wondering what happens to coffee in such an environment. Though, yes, air conditioners are on for majority of the time but not always. I was thinking that the extreme temperature combined with such a humid environment must surely impact the coffee. How long do you think a normal light roast should last in such an environment? What measures should I consider, if any? 

All of this given I buy a KG of beans at once. I understand that this problem might not occur to many people living in Europe or some parts of North America but here in Asia, this seems to me a problem. Any suggestions?",1614019317

Coffee,DeckertheDude,lpugp1,Complications with Capresso Infinity. Burr wearing?,"I've had my Infinity for about 3 years now, and it's been more than adequate for all of my pour overs and Aeropress coffees. However, lately my extraction times for my Hario V60 have increased to 3:30-4:00m at a couple clicks coarser than usual for a typical 3:00-3:30 extraction time. Nothing has changed with my beans, recipes or ratios. I suspect the grinder is producing more fines that are clogging up the filter and reducing the flow rate. I would expect that a grinder's burr wearing would cause the opposite effect, where you compensate the wear by grinding finer. Does anyone have this same issue where they're forced to grind coarser over time due to increased fines?",1614015302
Coffee,k20392,lptk1z,[Help] Creating my own South Indian filter coffee blend,"Hello!

I recently bought a Cuisinart Burr grinder in an effort to make  my own South Indian filter coffee blend.

From what I've read, South Indian filter coffee primarily is made with roasted Arabica coffee beans and chicory in a range of 80-20 to 55-45 proportion of coffee-chicory.

Ground: Slightly more coarse than espresso

I decided to take it one step at a time, but realizing that I would need to buy beans at the right roast, and also have roasted chicory and feel kinda lost.

Will appreciate help from the community on pointers for the same. Thank you!",1614013289
Coffee,The-Adster,lptjfx,Coffee Recommendation?,"Hey all, I'm new to this thread, but I am an avid coffee drinker.

Firstly, I use a Keurig with K-cups to make my coffee. Secondly, for the past couple of years, I have been loving plain Folgers Black Silk coffee (I like my coffee bitter). However, I've been wanting to try a new brand; maybe something more bitter/stronger.

What would you recommend for someone like me? Someone who enjoys bitter, strong, plain black coffee. K-cup variety would be preferred, but I could definitely invest in getting the reusable K-cups.

Thanks in advance!",1614013257
Coffee,cblackwe93,lptdbh,Home Brew Grind Settings HELP,"So I am a big fan of making coffee in different ways, I find it fascinating (as I'm sure you all do) how differently the process can make it taste. Usually I'll do Pour Over, French Press, Aero Press on the weekends when time affords it to have a better cup.

That being said, we have a Breville Precision Brewer as the *daily driver* if you will to whip something up on the go. I recently convinced my wife to let me buy the Precision Grinder as well do we can finally switch from grounds to beans for a better experience (and since we plan to get another espresso machine in the next year). 

After going through nearly a 2lb bag of Starbucks coffee (best bean available from Costco) I am finding it difficult to dial in...perhaps because of the complexity but I do want to learn. When its too sour I increase brew time/finer grind setting, when its too bitter I do the opposite. But, a lot of these changes I'm finding are two steps forward one step back type deal. Is there some generic advice anyone has for how to find the best setting or make incremental adjustments intelligently to find that \*perfect cup\*? 

With the precision brewer I can adjust settings there too which is honestly something I haven't considered fiddling with yet.

TLDR; any advice on how to sensibly adjust grind settings to find the best cup of coffee",1614012868
Coffee,Our-lastnight,lpt2t0,Can super fresh beans increase underdeveloped and grassy notes in a coffee?,"So I bought some Washed Honduran coffee beans from Kiss The Hippo (U.K.) However, they just taste underdeveloped grassy and vegetal. It’s surprising because Kiss The Hippo are generally pretty great. It’s definitely not an extraction issue (I.e. technique or temperature etc) but they are super fresh ... so I wonder if it’s that contributing to the developed notes ?",1614012168
Coffee,enrvuk,lpsmh8,Advice on equipment needed - non-milk household - ease and hobbiest users,"Hi All, looking to tap into some of the expertise on the sub, thanks in advance!

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to establish the best equipment mix for our use case, but haven't got there yet. We currently have a close to 10 year old Delonghi Magnifica, which when descaled and clean gives a drinkable coffee. It's super reliable. We buy our beans in the UK from [hasbean.co.uk](https://hasbean.co.uk) tending towards the cheaper end of their range, because I don't think the machine will do more expensive beans justice. (c. £8 per 250g) They are roasted to order, so it's fresh.

My wife enjoys a good Americano, but with quite a lot of water. Her priority is ease of use bean to cup, no milk. She can tell the difference between different beans we use, but isn't overly fussy.

I like either a short black or an espresso and  want to use better beans and to experiment to get a better coffee. 

Is there a machine that is simple to use, can deliver a healthy sized Americano and will allow me to up my coffee game and get the most from more expensive beans? Ease of use for my wife is as important as my flavour hunt.

Would I be better off sticking with a decent bean to cup machine and going to the Chemex route myself with a separate grinder? One additional complication, our kitchen isn't huge, so having a bean to cup and a grinder isn't ideal.

Thanks if you got this far!!",1614011120

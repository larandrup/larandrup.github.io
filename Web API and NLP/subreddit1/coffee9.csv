So I bought a Cold Brew maker on Amazon, and I literally haven‚Äôt bought Iced Coffee (and fast food in general lol) in two weeks! It‚Äôs saved me so much money and it tastes so good.


Also, I take medication for ADHD so I have to control my caffeine intake. So i would (stupidly) skip my meds so I could drink Iced Coffee. But now I can make Decaf Cold Brew! So I‚Äôve been doing that.


So in short Cold Brew coffee has allowed me to save money AND drastically improved my mental health since I take my medication consistently and still get my coffee fix üòÖ

I picked up some Stumptown Holler Mtn (never had any, just chose this blend first for fun) after hearing some people talk about it. French press is like the nicest method I have of making coffee at the moment. 

I‚Äôm currently on my second attempt at this particular blend and there‚Äôs something odd about it to me.. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the coffee but I‚Äôm trying to get it dialed in. Note: I‚Äôve made French press before with other blends that I thought came out well. 

Here‚Äôs my process maybe you guys can help me figure out what‚Äôs up:

Grind size 14 on a cuisinart conical burr (I know it‚Äôs not the best but it‚Äôs what I have). This is the second notch on the ‚ÄúFrench press‚Äù settings. Tried 16 first time and it was pretty bad and weak. 14 worked fairly well for some random other blend the other day so I started here.

Filtered water into kettle, let it sit to 204 degrees.

Poured half way to bloom grinds, 1 min, broke it up, filled the rest up and went 3 min then pressed.

I guess sour is the best description? I realize now maybe I don‚Äôt know the difference between sour and bitter lol.  I know the bag says it has a citrusy note to it but it‚Äôs almost like someone just squirted lemon juice into my coffee. I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong here....

Coffee,Binary101010,ljd7zf,Ready to upgrade grinder for brew but unsure about options,"I recently started brewing with a V60 and it's become increasingly clear that my OXO burr grinder is becoming the most frustrating part of my coffee experience. It can't even get through 24g in 30 seconds (so I have to press the button more than once), there's retention of 1g+, it's uneven, I'm just not enjoying it. So I'm looking to spend some cash on a better grinder, but the problem is that the discussion seems to jump from the \~$150 range (Encore) to the super-high end ($1K+) and not much near the upper end of my budget.

Some specifics about my situation:

Location: US (So by my understanding this largely disqualifies Wilfa products)

Budget: Up to $400USD before the missus starts asking questions

Brew type: Primarily V60 with dark and medium roasts, followed by french press with same. No real interest in trying to do espresso at home in the foreseeable future.

Grind volume: Single-dosing  24g or 30g at a time. I might do up to 42g if I want to totally fill my french press but I can't really see ever needing more than that at once.

Willingness to mod: Minimal. I'm at the point where I'd really rather just have the best thing I can get out of the box without having to futz with it too much (especially if we're talking voiding the warranty).

I'd been looking seriously at the Ode but all the reviews I seem to watch of it have some weird kind of off-putting vibes leading me to question if it's worth spending double what an Encore would cost.

So is there something in that \~$300-$400 range that I'm missing? Or will I really be just as happy for my situation with an Encore and an extra $250 in my bank account?

Coffee,slothoncoffee-,ljbg7c,Is a switch from MBK Aerspeed to Comandante C40 MK3 going to result in a big difference in taste?,"I bought the Aerspeed roughly a year ago and it's producing good and tasty coffee, but to me the size distribution isn't that great. After opening a bag of fresh beans I can reproduce the stated flavours for like 1 or 2 days and then it's nearly impossible for me to taste them again. 

Why is that? Is it because of the inconsistency in the grind sizes or is the coffee losing so much of its aroma in this short period of time? Does a switch from the Aerspeed to the Comandante lead to a big difference in taste at the beginning of a fresh bag of coffee and the time after? Or will this be a waste of money to switch the grinder? I'm considering buying the comandante and selling the Aerspeed because the grind consistency starts to bother me but I can't tell if I'm just too picky right now or if this is going to really make a difference.

Right now I'm using the Aeropress, a French Press and the Sage precision brewer as my methods for brewing coffee.",1613256935

Coffee,ApostropheJ,lj666n,I'm Probably Doing This Wrong,"Let me start off by bragging that I went to black coffee three years ago and haven't looked back. I was a creamer ADDICT but now, creamer nauseates me.

I can only handle cold brew. Hot coffee upsets my stomach and when hot turns to room temperature, it's just foul. 

What I probably do wrong:

1. I don't mess with ratios. I just add my coarse grounds into the French press and add water. I do refrigerate for 8-10 hours.
2. I don't pay attention to ""notes"" of flavors and the science behind it. I just like what I like. I buy medium or medium to dark roasts. 
3. I don't dilute it with extra water or ice. I just pour and go. I personally like it this way, others who try my coffee say it's WAY too strong. I like it so thick, I can chew it. I don't do sissy coffee.

I have debated buying a scale and weighing the grounds before I add but why? I have become picky with my beans. I don't buy Starbucks beans (EW! And they make me physically sick). There's a local shop about 20 miles away that sells extremely wonderful roasts. I spend close to $130/month on beans. 

I grind coarse with a regular grinder, pour them into my 32 oz. French press, add water to just below the lip, cover with Saran wrap, refrigerate overnight, then pour and go. I like the taste even though others prefer theirs with ice and added water.",1613241158
Coffee,MacysShopper,lj5zgx,Does burr grinder really need cleaned?,"I've been using burr grinder for two months and loved the result. The difference is obvious, better coffee and consistency everyday. I'm looking at cleaning instructions but wonder if it is necessary. My hope is that when every batch runs through the burr, it strips away some of the older residues, so every a few batches can refresh the oldest residues. Just like my cooking oil dispenser, I never have to clean it, always replenish the dispenser with new oil to mix with the leftover. It never goes stale. I never smelled or tasted anything unpleasant so far.  

Does anyone has same experience, never having to clean burr?  Thanks in advance.",1613240608

I bought a metal filter for my chemex for convenience since I live in a dorm and I feel as if it's messing with my brew process because it drains very fast. 

This is my process: 21g coffee to 350g water, ground a little finer than normal pourover probably in a JX pro. Water fresh off the boil, 50g water and 30 second bloom. Then 180g pour, wait 30 seconds. Then 120g pour, give it a stir, then finished. I took these intervals from James Hoffman, but I think having a metal filter completely throws them off; after the 30 seconds of each cycle all the coffee is already drained. The coffee I get is still pretty good, but it feels like it's missing something and I enjoy my french press cups more. Any tips from people with metal filters or should I just start buying paper ones?",1613237030

Coffee,smeedorian,lj2rb2,How do you when to adjust grind size vs amount of grounds!,"Hey all. 

I have a Breville/Sage barista pro. I generally just adjust grind size to try to get from roughly 8-30 seconds of espresso with generally good results. 

Recently I had a coffee go from good to great after increasing the grind time by a second. Up until now I‚Äôve mainly just kept a consistent level of grounds regardless of bean and just adjust if that looks a bit low or too full. 

I think I have a good grasp on the sour under extracted taste and the bitter over extracted taste, but have only used the grind size to correct there. 

Should I be adjusting the amount of grounds more and what should inform that setting?

Also with all these variables how do I get a bean dialed in before half the bag is used?!

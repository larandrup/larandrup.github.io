Coffee,tinclan,l293z4,Screw holding shower screen onto group head broke in half in a Breville (Sage) Oracle. Any idea how I can remove the screw from the group head?,"Hey guys, I came across a used Breville Oracle for 200 Bucks on eBay. I bought it knowing it's probably not in good shape, which is kind of true. However the machine is mostly functional.. Grinding and tamping works, Steam boiler works, Espresso Boiler also works, but the machine was quite dirty. I did a couple of back flushes, but it still looked full of old coffee, so I ran it through a clean cycle with a Cafiza Pill (essentially just multiple rounds of back flushing).
Unfortunately the screw holding the shower screen ended up breaking during the clean cycle. it seems to be somewhat standard, and I might even be able to buy an original one, but they're currently out of stock.
The bigger problem though is that I don't know if it's possible to get the broken screw out of where it broke. I don't know what this plastic part between the boiler and the portafilter is. I can probably take it apart, but I thought I'd ask for advice first, maybe someone can point in a specific direction?

Coffee,Polymathy1,l292et,"Percolators - ""brew strength"" adjustment? Buying new","Hello, fellow coffee people!

Once upon a time, I bought a GE electric coffee percolator from the 60s (give or take 10 years). It had an adjustment on it for strength, which as far as I ciuld tell was an adjustment for brew time. i gav eit to a friend long ago. Anyway, now that I'm working from home, I want to get another one. I know some people dislike them, but I loved the coffee I made with it.

What did the brew strength adjustment actually do? I always had it turned to maximum or pretty close.

I'd rather buy new because I have food allergies and celiac, so I generally buy kitchen items new. I haven't seen any electric percolators that have any kind of adjustment on them. Is this feature not available anymore? I would hate to buy one and then find out it makes tragically weak coffee. 

If need be, I'll get a stovetop perc, but I would prefer electric for the keep-warm feature - if it only keeps it warm for an hour or so. Yes, I know a keep-warm feature heresy to some, but it's how I like it.",1611266905

Coffee,angryherbalist,l24k48,New to bean selection (and general coffee snobbery lol)... Trying to get to the right flavor.,"I've been buying some high quality beans from some of the sources listed in other threads on this sub.

I use an Aeropress and I believe my methodology is right on the money (20g, inverted, bypass to 300cc total, etc)

I've noticed that, say Nicaragua beans, seem to have an ""olive"" taste.  I had just eliminated the beefy taste from too much coffee.

Is the ""olive"" taste normal to coffee in any sense? Is that a methodology thing? Do the coffee fruit have this type of taste, and is this the ""sweet"" people describe?

I'm just trying to get rid of the me problems so i can focus on which beans i like best.

Coffee,kitkat6199,l23llc,Breville Bambino Plus Users: Consistently Under-Extracted Shots?,"Hello coffee community! 

After much agonizing over which Breville machine to get, I ended up going with the Breville Bambino Plus. The convenience of the automatic milk steaming and the quick heat-up ultimately won me over. I got the Capresso Infinity grinder to go with it. I realize these aren't top-of-the-line models, but the ease of use and price range made them seemingly my best options. 

I busted it out today and started trying to use it, but I am consistently getting under-extracted shots. I have no idea where I'm going wrong. I started in the ""fine"" range on my Capresso grinder and then tried using the lower end of the ""extra fine""; I tried using more espresso grounds and packing it more tightly/using more pressure. But still my espresso streams out too quickly. 

This is my first machine using dual-walled baskets instead of single-walled baskets so perhaps that's why I'm noticing the difference? I'm an espresso amateur for the most part, but have made it at home for years (previously used a Gaggia and then the Breville Infuser). Maybe I need to invest in a better grinder?

I'd appreciate any advice from people who have used these machines!",1611251436

Coffee,Che_galego,l1xyon,Clever Dripper - I'm not finding the flavours I was expecting,"Hi everyone, nice to meet you, first post in here. I've been following this subreddit and the coffee world for the last 3-4 months. Saved a couple of bucks and recently bought a wilfa uniform grinder, a clever dripper and a gooseneck kettle for my first setup.

The first two coffee beans that I bought were Ethiopian (Guji, natural) and Colombian (Cauca, fully washed) both tagged as ""Filter Roast"" and they look light-medium roasted.  
Due to covid the Clever Dripper had a delay on the delivery... and since I was excited to start using the grinder and the beans, I borrowed a cheap espresso machine (old delonghi icona) from my gf parents. I've pulled some shots during the week and I really enjoyed the Ethiopian beans acidic and floral? notes, it was really different from what I was used to from capsules espresso\\instant coffee\\wtv. The Colombian's were ok but didnt have that unexpected taste.   


That been said, I was looking forward to have that taste on a bigger cup with the clever dripper, obviously not the same intensity but at least some things that I enjoyed (especially the acidicy).  
During this week I've been using the Clever, 60-65g - 1L  with 2-3min brew (I follow the Hoffmann way of doing it) and writing down every thing. The problem is... I dont get much of a flavour or acidicy from any of the beans :(, I'm even getting a tastier cup from the Colombian's tbf.   
After trying a lot of different grind sizes and not getting any distint characteristics from the each coffee, I've even done two cups of the same beans, one with really course grounds (34 on the wilfa for the ones who have it) and one with really fine grounds (14) to see in which grind should I aim for... The courser was kinda meh and watery, the finer at least had some harsness to it lol but not what I wanted.

Do I have unreallistic expectations on the flavours I should be able to get on my Clever Dripper from the espresso experience?   
Are the flavours on the Clever that subtle? Because I was able to perflectly differenciate each bean and its characteristics on the espresso shots.",1611233949

Coffee,thatsOKbro,l1xgsi,Is there any information out there on tolerance and how it determines the strength of the effect caffeine has on you?,"Kind of a weird question but I was on a longggg caffeine break (6 months) and I am back but even a cup of tea effects me pretty strongly. I get the same “crash” that I used to after having one too many cups of coffee. If I had a cup of coffee right now, I wonder if it would be so intense that I get super jittery. I’m about to pick up a half caff and see how it goes. 

So I’m curious how tolerance is effecting the effect of the caffeine on me and how can it be manipulated? Say I want to avoid that caffeine crash and increase my tolerance, would my tolerance be back to normal if I just deal with the effects of too much caffeine until it’s bearable again? Or would you recommend slowly increasing my intake by starting with one cup of tea, up to two cups, up to multiple cups a day, up to espresso, up to coffee? 

I know this doesn’t matter to most people but I really want to avoid the negative effects of caffeine as much as possible which only occur when my tolerance is too low so I’m wondering how tolerance interacts with my intake",1611231886

While still being somewhat new to high quality equipment when it comes to brewing, my cup today had a weird vegital, almost grass-like note, apart from that it was the best grind setting I""ve found for theese beans. Grinding even a little  coarser felt underextracted to me,  it was sour, and hollow (and countrary to what everyone says. it was still suprisingly bitter after the overwhelming sourness). Grinding coarser didn't help either. There are some questions rising in me, mainly the quality of the roast (Its a medium-light roast IMO, for filter, and a reknown brand here, in Hungary. Oh, and the beans are from Burundi). Could this indicate a faulty roast, or is it a faulty technique? If the latter, how do I correct it? Where to go in terms of grind size from here?

I read very different thoughts about it. Do you experience a certain temp stability to make it possible? I know I know the charme of a la pavoni is exactly this kind of unpredictability but nevertheless. you can for example upgrade the pro with a group head manometer to see exactly the kind of pressure you wanna level. I won‘t pull 3-4 shots in a row, just 1-2 and then turn it off.

I hope you get my point and im looking forward for your thoughts. Cheers",1611159474
Coffee,Dragon_Lord_1080p,l1ca48,Looking for a slow CONE SHAPED dripper.,"For quite some time i have been consuming lighter roasts coffee. But recently the thought of darker roasted coffees have occupied my mind.  I personally own a large collection of drippers. Hario v60 in glass, plastic and ceramic as well as switch variation, Kadou m1 starman by hasami, kalita waves and trapezoids, cafecs flower dripper, timemore's crystal eyes, origami drippers. 

Brewing a dark roast comes down to separating the grind size and brew time. ( grinding coarser yet brewing longer) unlike lighter roasts where grinding finer and pushing for faster speeds seems to be quite the trend. I was wondering if anybody had any **slow flow Cone shaped drippers** they can recommend me to add to my collection. Personally i have been looking at Koandro's Drill Dripper. But if you have any recommendations or reviews of some of the drippers not mentioned that are slower flowing  pls drop them here.  (except kono meimons )

I understand that i can use tools such as cafecs  TH-1, TH-3 or dark roast specific papers or a chemex to possibly control the flow using the filter papers instead. I just wanna know what other crazy things others might be coming up with",1611159294

This morning, however, I ran into my first problem with it. I noticed that after grinding at what I thought should have been 18 clicks, my grind size was a little all over the place. 

I then checked to make sure I was 18 clicks away from point 0 on the burrs, and was surprised to find that not only did I go past 18 clicks, I couldn't get the burrs to catch at all because the lower burr (with the little ring of craters in it) was not being stable when I made my clicks - it sort of 'jumps' when I click to the next adjustment point. 

I haven't given the grinder a total disassembled cleaning since I bought it, and maybe reassembly will fix whatever's going on here - but I was wondering if anyone else has seen this happen.

Coffee,Jonny_Panino,l1a3vg,Please Suggest the Best Setup for Me,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent the last week throwing myself into the rabbit hole of coffee. I've researched plenty, trying to understand what I like and what I don't, what my needs are and how I can meet them. I've read plenty on the grinder side of things, and I know that a reasonable entry-level choice for my needs could be around £200-£250. However, I'm a bit at a loss when it comes to choosing the right machine without breaking the bank (ideally I'd spend around as much as the grinder).

How I envision coffee as a hobby for myself (and this is very personal!) will affect the setup that is right for me, so I will write it down here and hopefully it'll help tailor your suggestions.

**Things I want to do** with this hobby: 

\- try different beans and understand the different flavours

\- make nice (emphasis on nice, not necessarily world-class..) espressos and milky drinks (from cortados to lattes), these really are the only drinks I care about. 

\- to a certain extent, learn new skills. For example, trying to apply different brew pressures or different grind settings, different doses, etc (please forgive me if I don't speak the lingo yet). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I do NOT want to do** as I would not find enjoyable (and again, this is personal, you might love this stuff): 

\- spending many minutes prepping the equipment. Waiting time is OK, but I can't afford to be assembling things, grinding manually, warming things up, cleaning 100 different bits and bobs. (eg I've seen some manual machines like the Flair and I am not much into the idea of doing all of that assembly with many pieces. I like the concept of applying pressure manually though as it's part of ""learning a new skill"" as described above)

\- be too worried about brewing the 100% perfect  cup every single day. Yes, maybe in the future I'll get addicted and I will want to be extremely anal about every single detail, but for now I don't see myself e.g. weighing every single day the ""liquid output"" (again, sorry for not speaking the lingo) to make sure I follow some specific ratio, or worrying that I have 19.5g ground coffee in the basket instead of 19g. Yes I can do it sometimes if I feel like it, and especially if it's the weekend, but on weekdays I would probably like to ballpark my coffee prep most of the times and enjoy a good cup without worrying about the minuscule details. Being geeky is nice and appealing, I love numbers and I see myself doing it but not full time, it must be on my own terms. 

So in general I want to experiment and I do want to learn and try new things, but I don't want it to be 100% science, and I know that if there's too much prepping, cleaning &amp; measuring involved I risk not having enough patience to keep at it in the long term (especially the prepping - for some it's a ritual, for me it's a chore). I don't know if I'm explaining myself clearly. 

In case you were thinking of suggesting it, I don't like moka coffee (and as an Italian I don't feel snobby/elitist saying that espresso is a different drink). I would mostly make coffee for myself and possibly my girlfriend (but she doesn't drink espresso). I'm pretty sure that if I didn't have the requirement of wanting to make good espresso, my life would be much simpler.

Coffee,Molasar,l19wz8,Bonavita Water Level Lines and Brew Ratio,"Confused about Bonavita water tank level marks. We make a full put with our 8-cup 1901TS. I know they use 5 ounces as a cup, so 8 cups would theoretically yield 40 oz of coffee. However, when you fill the water tank to the ""Max"" 8-cup mark, it's much more than 40 ounces of water.

So is the Bonavita just accounting for water lost through evaporation from the heating? Or is it just inaccurate?

We've been filling to the max line and using 66 g of beans, which would be a 1:17 ratio for 40 oz of water. The coffee tastes good, but I'm curious how everyone else is dealing with this and interpreting the brew ratio witht hese machines.

Do I calculate my coffee to water ratio based on the amount of water in the tank, or the amount of coffee yielded?",1611151908
Coffee,SomebodyInACity,l19vyj,"It's cliché, but having good coffee truly does make a difference!","I really did not like coffee all that much, I thought it was too bitter, too musty, etc.  
Then i fell down the rabbithole.

I got curious, bought a cheap handgrinder, got REALLY frustrated, decided coffee wasn't for me at all  
got curious again, got a comandante c40 which improved things DRAMATICALLY, but still stuck to the beans I was using at the time, which were some supermarket lavazza beans. Now, they were noticably better than everything I was used to, but when I started making pourovers I really, really ran face first into all the problems with them. My philosophy behind sticking with the bad beans is that I could have something to practise technique with, and if I could learn how to make the supermarket beans taste good, I could probably make amazing coffee with good beans. 

However, at a certain point there wasn't anything I could do to make things taste any better. I'd gotten some pretty ok coffee out of it in the beginning, when I was still clumsy with pouring and making underextracted brews. It made weak coffee with a nice strong caramel/cream scent that I liked a lot. When I got better at it and my extraction went up, the coffee got worse and worse. It still had the same lovely fragrance that I loved, but it just started tasting of cardboard. I decided to investigate, I brewed at a lot of different grind settings, and apart from it getting weaker and more hollow at coarser settings and more musty and cardboardy to bitter at finer settings.

In hindsight, it's pretty obvious. I recently ordered some good coffee beans from a local roastery, and the difference is clear as day. I compared what I could see, I smelled the beans and even ate a coffee bean or 2. Some things I learned from that:

1. Beans should smell and taste good and aromatic, not like dirt and cardboard
2. There shouldn't be broken beans in the bag
3. A good grind doesn't improve your coffee, it only gives you clarity on it's quality.

When I brewed with the new coffee I got, I had some coffee from Panama, even though it acted way different because of the lighter roast, and I didn't get the grind down perfectly first try, i could taste SO much, way more than I could ever dream of with the other beans. If you got a good grinder, you shouldn't have to fight for at least an okay tasting cup of coffee. The coffee i got was much more closer to tea than I ever imagined coffee could be. It had this earl-grey like quality both in astringency and presence of this bergamot taste, citrussy and herb-like, with notes of thyme rising up to my nose after I took a sip. Far better than having a hit of nice roasty sweetness followed by glue and paper and phenolic notes.

Having a good grinder is absolutely key, but having good coffee is most certainly not to be underestimated either. I'm having a lot of fun with it, it makes the brewing into a much more culinary experience. I don't think i could ever go back. Thanks to the community for answering my questions and teaching me about this interesting world!

Coffee,cartographer00,l19hss,Has anyone tried to extract with hot milk?,"I was just thinking about this today:

Take an Aeropress. I don't have one on me right now, but I normally extract with water and then add a bit of milk and sugar at the end, as I'd imagine many people do.

But what would happen if you heated up the milk and simply used *that* to steep the coffee and press through it?

My thoughts are that fat-soluble compounds in coffee are more difficult to extract than water-soluble compounds because, well, water is polar and fat isn't. They don't attract and fat won't dissolve in water.

But milk has a mixture of fat and water. Would extracting with milk allow for more extraction of the fat-soluble compounds in the coffee? And would these fat-soluble compounds actually taste good?",1611150507

I cant ""dial"" in my Hario brew. It just comes out too weak and not ""roasty"" enough. 
Here is what I do: 

Boil water, as it just off the boil... 
Grind 20-22g about a handful of illy beans in a coffee grinder. I don't have a fancy one with dial settings
I am going for the finer side as I find this stronger 
In goes a hario filter, I fold at crease
Pour in about 50g of water swish it around let the decanter warm up. Discard the water. 
Add the grounds to the paper. 
Pour in another 50g and let the coffee oxidise for about 30sec
Then slowly pour in concentric circles till I get to about 200ml and let it steep which doesn't take too long 
I use the James Hoffman method. Tried doing the circles in stages too didn't make much difference 
And now when I pour the coffee in my cup I am pouring about 3/4 of the cup with coffee.

Coffee,arielperro,l8p41k,How to bring out the whole flavor in the bean?,I'm brewing a medium roasted Ethiopian Yirgacheffe that was roasted around 2 weeks ago by a local Ethiopian roastery with an Aeropress (16g coffee + 40g water + 1 min steep and 20 sec press). I've been experimenting with my recipe and I've managed to get a really sweet brew. It's definitely pleasant to drink  (very long sweet finish) but I feel like its lacking that complexity and balance I'm looking for. Should I grind finer and/or steep longer? I'm afraid that I might get some bitter flavors from overextraction if so. Is it just the bean's flavor profile? Any tips would be appreciated.,1612023768
Coffee,DonBombadil,l8p12n,"French press advice? Specifically fineness of the grind, brew times, and for different roasts/varieties.","Using the Hoffmann method, I'm not sure how fine to grind. I have a 1Z JX, and I don't know if for the Hoffmann method I should be grinding in the aeropress, or pour over range, or maybe the bottom of the FP range. Then how long to let it sit, is that dependent on the grind size? Should I grind say, fruitier  lighter coffees on a different setting than darker coffees? I'm not sure.

But my big question is grind size, how fine should I go on this one as a general guideline of what yo guys use. Then what are the symptoms I've gone too fine and need to dial back up. Thanks!",1612023555

Coffee,thelilster,l8nm2z,No portafilter &lt;-&gt; grouphead seal on Breville Barista Express,"Had the Breville Barista Express for 18 months now. At around the 15 month mark, I had a blowout in the gasket (one part of the gasket comes over the shower screen), and was occasionally experiencing water running over the portafilter into the cup directly. Without realizing that, I used it maybe 10-12 times wondering what was going wrong.   


I bought a new gasket, replaced it, and noticed the pressure was a little looser when locking the portafilter into the grouphead (i.e. it would turn further to the right, with less pressure). After around 2-3 months (now at 18 months), it started blowing out every time (and I would re-seat it, and it would blow out again).   


I bought a new gasket, and installed it, and now when I turn the portafilter there is absolutely no seal at all. I can turn it all the way to the end with a single finger with no resistance. It never locks. How does this happen? Has the grouphead plastic gotten loose from the previous blowouts putting too much pressure on it, widening it a few millimetres? Is there any fix for this?

When brewing regular coffee, I can definitely tell the difference between beans and this got me excited to try all different sorts.

I feel like I should just get some supermarket beans to use for them as it doesn't even matter.

Coffee,GreyWolfx,l8lm6k,What's a good Thermos recommendation for the following usage?,"So I pretty much make 2 to 3 mugs of Tea, instant cappuccino or Hot coco a day and promptly feel compelled to damn near chug the stuff in order to finish it before it gets cold. I do this sitting at the computer, and suffice to say, that's not the best way to enjoy your hot drink haha, but it's been my routine regardless.

Really it just dawned on me that I could probably be saving myself from having to make the stuff 3 times a day, and also save myself from racing against the clock to finish the drink before it gets cold with just one change: getting a good Thermos.

So yeah, what are some of your favorite Thermos', and can you guys think of any that are suitable for my needs of making a batch of some hot drink early in the day, and just drinking from it at my desk for the rest of the day? I do have a traditional Glass mug that I could potentially pour from the Thermos into if you think that would be the best way to do it, but if I can drink straight from the Thermos that would be cool too.

* Something that holds 25-30+ oz or more would be ideal
* Needs to retain the heat throughout the day
* Great if I can drink straight from the Thermos
* Is there a such thing as a thermos that helps keep a drink ""mixed"" because I notice my hot Coco separates and needs stirring frequently
* I'll be sitting it on my desk at my computer, so ideally something that if it falls over won't risk a spill onto my keyboard etc haha

Anyways, I'm just really interested in hearing what you guys all have to say about this.

I won't be completing the work myself, as this is my first conversion so I'm hiring professionals. Also a Land Rover is a more expensive route, but it's a nostalgia thing more than anything. There's not enough space to stand in the back, so a hatch will be cut into the side of the car for the coffee machine/grinder etc. with the fridge in the back of the car. This leaves me more exposed to the elements, I'm planning on having an awning, but this is probably unlikely to give me much cover from the horizontal rain. I've worked on a farm for most of my life, so know what it's like to be outside in all seasons. I'm hoping that this experience will provide me with some mental and physical resilliance against the weather, but it is something I'm worried about. 

I still need to decide on a base and apply for relevant permits, but there is plenty of footfall in central Edinburgh so I'm confident I will find somewhere. I'll be selling good quality coffee &amp; cakes to start with, potentially increasing my products once I'm aware of my capabilities. I worked in a cafe for a year, but that was three years ago now so I will definitely be receiving some training from my roaster. 

It would be great to get some advice from anyone who has worked in/owns a mobile coffee unit on the following points:

2. Do you have any tips on how to keep your work-area more sheltered?

4. Did you have any complications which you didn't expect when you started running the business? 
5. What kind of energy-system did you use? What were it's drawbacks?

Coffee,ecm_confusika,l8aw37,ECM Synchronika w/ Flow Control sour???,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; espresso is sour, I have 4 questions-

1) **Do you recommend going up to 210 or does that indicate I'm doing something wrong?**

2) **Does higher pressure (i.e. 9 bars instead of 6) result in more or less sourness?**

3) **How does flow rate affect extraction? When sour, should I decrease or increase flow rate? How about when acidic?**

4) **How does channeling affect extraction? Does it have the ability to also make a coffee sour or just acidic?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making espresso for 7 years on a Breville Barista Express and have finally gotten my next upgrade. My machine is an ECM Synchronika with Flow Control, and my grinder is a Ceado E37S. I have had these machines for 2 months now and it sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

This evening I spent another 2 hours going through about every video I could find, and 3 pounds of fresh coffee. The beans I used this evening were roasted on the 27th of January (just two days ago). Every single shot I pulled was sour. I will upload an image for your entertainment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need someone's help with this, and I'm not a reddit regular but I'm hoping you guys have some experience to help me out here. I'm sure there is something I am missing, I have never even touched a machine this nice so there's probably something stupid going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**ECM**

I moved the temperature up to 210 Fahrenheit, and that seems to have helped but it's unusual to have to go that high. My Breville only needed to be raised \~+/- 2 degrees from 198 and was not this sour using the same water. My **first question is Do you recommend going up to 210 or does that indicate I'm doing something wrong?** I have backflushed the ECM using Cafiza powder. Keep in mind this is a brand new machine though (not even refurbished). The water I am using is filtered, via a Brita filter. The portafilter is hot, the boiler shows it's reaching pressure (9 bars), and with flow control I can even see that the group head is also reaching 9 bars. **My second question is Does higher pressure result in more or less sourness?** I also tried playing around with no flow control, flow control etc. I left the flow control device open 1/4 revolution for 5 seconds, then opened by 1 full revolution. I did the same with the device open 1/4 for 10, then 1 revolution. Irrespective of flow control settings, I taste the coffee with my finger when it's coming out in the cup in those initial stages and it's sour. Needless to say the cups are also sour. **Third question is How does flow rate affect extraction?** Different flow rates can yield the same pressure. That is to say that with 1 revolution I can get 9 bars, heck even with 1/4 a revolution I can hit 9 bars if it's too fine a grind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**E37 S** 

The E37S does not evenly distribute grinds. I'm surprised nobody has published anything about this but I will share a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0c2zBYYvX4) from a fellow poor soul. I am following his technique but don't yet have a distributor or bottomless portafilter (coming in soon) to make sure I am evenly distributed. I eyeball it and it looks like one side is higher than the other by a bit. I am hesitant to tamp again, and seldomly get even distributions with the E37s.  My **fourth question How does channeling affect extraction?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Beans**

Could this just be it? Why sell beans that aren't ready? How long should I actually wait? What beans should I buy? What beans are not fucking sour? What beans are good? Plz help",1611971747

Baratza's grind size guide shows that all else equal, 15 on the Encore and 5M on the Vario should be the correct setting for a V60. 15 is indeed where I was grinding for a V60 on the Encore for most coffees, however 5M is much finer than that. In fact 10M seems to be comparable in size, but it produces far more fines so my brews are stalling out. 

Any experience with this? Any suggestions?",1611965045

No biggie, but using a standard 16g espresso grind - 32g liquid ratio in the double sized cup is leaving me with the liquid being trapped during extraction and only a few tiny droplets leaking out into the cup. Clearly the grind is too fine. 

I tried using another cup and tampered it very lightly to try and get a loose pack to no avail.

Coffee,DaytonaRx,l7vwbo,Help! What am I doing wrong with my espresso extraction?,"Hi,

I just got an espresso machine upgrade and the whole extraction process seems off, but I’ve run out of ideas as to what I could be doing wrong. Here is what I’m seeing during my extraction process:

1. The puck always has a dent right in the middle because there’s a screw right in the middle of the group head screen and I’m not sure if it’s normal to have that. I’ve tried a 20g filter basket and a 21g filter basket with a 20g dose and I see it in both of them... Am I just not tamping hard enough or should I be dosing less? Or would the dent not really affect my shot much?

2. During the extraction, the stream of espresso seems to come out towards the front, as opposed to being in the middle. This signals an uneven extraction to me, which intuitively tells me maybe my tamping is off? I’ve tried it with a distribution tool with and without tamping and it doesn’t seem to do much. My thought was that using only a distribution tool would probably give me a more even extraction if my tamping technique is off. This leads me to my 3rd question:

3. After each extraction, there’s always residue towards the bottom of the filter basket. Not sure what to make of that - probably a result of an uneven extraction?

I’ve uploaded some pictures of the portafilter below so you can see what I’m talking about.

Long time coffee drinker, newly minted coffee enthusiast, and very new member of the sub. Do you have any recommendations for this coffee consuming Canuck? I hope I haven't come in sounding like too much of an amateur. 

 I've been looking online for an affordable electronic, conical burr coffee grinder in the $100-$200cad range, and have come across a couple of offerings that have decently good online reviews... with the exception of one major element., like 
 - OXO's conical grinder (which clogs with oily beans), and 
 - Bodum's Bistro electronic grinder (which has the plastic support for its burrs that apparently shears relatively easily) 
 - Baratza Encore (gears get mauled relatively easily)

I've read a bunch of blogs and online reviews, and every unit i look at seems to have some sort of major fault associated with it if you do even just a bit of digging. So Reddit, I need your help!

Here are my basic requirements, they're nothing special:
- Its just me drinking coffee 99% of the time, so capacity is not really an issue
- My main brew method is currently French Press, so having a good coarse grind is important to me
- that being said, i'd be alright investing more money in a solid, all-round quality piece that will last me a long time.  I am willing to shell out some more money to make that one-time purchase that lasts me forever, as long as it is worth it!

Coffee,littlewing2,l7tw7k,Coffee and cholesterol,"Hi all,

First post on Reddit even though I’ve been on here for a while now. Forgive me if this comes out incorrectly!

My doctor mentioned my cholesterol levels were ever so slightly high, which is strange as I’ve no family history of it and I eat very well (no meat, plenty of veg, plenty of exercise). 

The doc whittled through a list of things I consume that could be causing it, and he specifically said whole-bean/ground coffee, not the crappy stuff in a jar at the supermarket but the proper stuff. Apparently ground and whole bean coffee, the latter especially, is high in cholesterol when consumed in larger quantities (2/3 cups a day, which is about what I have).

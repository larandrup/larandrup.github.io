Coffee,thomasqbrady,ksfv9w,Baratza Encore espresso grinding issues,"I bought a Baratza Encore a couple months ago, because it seemed to be nearly everyone's recommendation for ""best affordable grinder,"" and the reviews all said it was serviceable at espresso grind settings. Mine, however, won't go below about a 12 on its setting without clogging up immediately. The grind looks good, but the chute clogs up and nothing comes out before I can even grind a double shot. I'm using light roast beans that are not terribly oily. The only thing I can think that I'm doing that might be contributing to the problem is not keeping my beans in the hopper. I store them in an air tight can and only put the measured out beans into the hopper when grinding, and I'm wondering if the lack of the weight of the other beans is somehow the problem? Is it just me having this issue (i.e. is my grinder defective)? Any tips?",1610034441

Is the $100 more for Kinu Phoenix worth it, let alone the $200 for Simplicity? Is there someone out there that had a 1Zpresso JX Pro and switched to a Kinu?

Other info: I currently have a Baratza Encore for brewing with mostly V60/Origami. Iâ€™ll probably switch between grinding for espresso and pourover, which is why I shortlisted Kinu rather than Comandante. Also the Kinu M47 Classic (SGD 525) is way out of my budget.",1610034364

Coffee,mrmusic1590,ks9ju8,Does stale coffee 'absorb' less water?,"So quick background. I bought two bags of coffee (beans) back in september to use in my moka-pot that I hadn't used in a while. I experimented a bit, but I couldn't get any drinkable coffee out of it. No matter the grind size or technique I used, it always tasted horrible. So I just stopped drinking coffee altogether.

Flash-forward a few months and I get a V60 set for Christmas. Of course I start by using the (3-4 month) old coffee first, can't be wasteful. I practice my technique a bit, but somehow blooming never worked well. Every time I poured water on the coffee grounds, it just ran straight trough. I adjusted the grind size a bit finer, and finally it *just barely* absorbed enough water to bloom for 20 seconds or so.

This week I finally got through my old bags and bought a new bag of beans. And holy shit, now suddenly blooming is so easy. Just pouring like 30-40g of water on 15g of coffee is plenty, whereas with my old beans I could barely make it with 60g of water.

So I have a new job and people in the office were very interested with the short bio about me and my coffee that I wrote for myself in the company website. They wanted to have a taste and so I took up the challenge to make coffee just this one time, or should I probably postpone it until the next working day so I could prepare and secure more gear (just filters and more coffee really)?

I own a:

* Comandante C40

* V60 01 with barely enough filters

* Kalita Wave 155 and 185 but no filters

* A Fellow Stagg EKG and a Hario Buono 1L

* Likely not enough coffee (I ain't sharing my Geshas, sorry)
* Hario 450ml decanter (likely 50ml less than the planned 500ml per brew, but still actually fits)

My plan of attack is as follows given what I have now:

* Pour-over
* 200ml/12.5g (1:16) serves for each person
* with the V60 01, brew 3 cups every 5 minutes (is it possible?)
* Coarser grind, enough to keep the entire brewing process drip within 02:30
* 100c temp just to be sure
* No time to use fancy water, just tap
* 30 minutes to brew everything?

Coffee,midnightlounger,krzkga,Question about sub 10g brews,"Hello all, 

I have been surfing around the subreddit for a while now and started diving into making more coffee at home. 

I have been curious to ask if anyone here have much experiences with sub 10g brews. 

As well curious if there a method that favors smaller brews? i.e. 7.5-8g for a (1/4 cup/125ml) of coffee? Does coffee brewing even scale down well that low? Would be interesting to hear thoughts on this. Or could it be that at under 10grams there is simply not enough heat in the water for the duration of the brew time for a proper extraction? 

As much as I love the smell and taste of coffee in the morning I am rather sensitive to caffeine. Regular serving sizes (1cup/250ml/8oz) 15-20g at 1:16 simply makes too much coffee for me to comfortably drink in a sitting. I have resorted to saving the remaining coffee for the following day, warming it up in the microwave with some milk and sugar. I hate to waste coffee. 

Currently I use an old French press. Frequently finding my brews to be sour (perhaps under extracted from such small volumes?). I purchased a 1spresso jx pro from rogue wave up here in Canada as a Christmas present to myself to get better grind consistency, perhaps I have not been able to dial in the settings. 

I am looking at the following as possible alternatives to my French press

* Kalita wave 155 in sandstone.
* Hario V60 01 Clear plastic 
* Hario Switch 

I am leaning to the Kalita 155 as reviews of its easy brew consistency is appealing especially since I am not the most coordinated in the morning. As well  I am concerned about the potential ability to brew in the V60 well consistently with only 125g of water to work with. 

Will definitely purchase a goose neck kettle to have steady pours. 

I'd love to hear your experiences. Cheers.",1609974224

I've got a 3 group Iberital IB7, with 2 steam wands. Recently however, the left hand steam wand dial started getting stuck occasionally, but now it's almost completely stuck. It can turn maybe 3/4 of a complete rotation, but not enough to start the steam, as that needs at least a full rotation, if not more. I popped the dial off, and underneath I could see the steam valve insert. The little snap washer was bent out of shape, which I believe is what caused the dial to jam. [Here is an example of the full insert,](https://www.espressounderground.co.uk/VALVE-INSERT-ORIGINAL-PN-IB2383-p/ib2383.htm) and the washer sits at the front of that [and looks like this, but brass.](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-51wyxax1je/images/stencil/original/products/97102/52576/703432_1__47367.1583861789.jpg?c=2) The technical diagrams are [available online](https://www.iberital.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/iberital-IB7.pdf), and on page 4, you can see exactly the part I'm trying to describe.

So, my first question is can I just replace the washer? I removed the washer, and then from comparison to the non-faulty wand, I bent it back into shape, but was unable to snap it back onto the valve insert. Would the insert need to be disassembled to pop the washer back into place? Secondly, since the replacement insert is only Â£14, I might just go for that, but if I did would it just be as simple as unscrewing the old valve and screwing the new one on? [A youtube tutorial I found suggests that to be the case,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-u6f_NdgKE) but I wanted to check regardless. Would I need to turn off the machine and wait for it to cool down? Lastly, because I don't want to throw Â£50 away for the official tool, does anyone know what size socket I would need to remove the insert? I have an embarrassingly incomplete socket set at home, so might need to buy the right size separately.

Hopefully I've not just written a bunch of nonsense, I know absolutely nothing about machine servicing, so for all I know I'm completely on the wrong track!",1609956034

I've seen that there is a trick to start steaming before the indicator light goes on, but that doesn't make much of a difference when I've tried it.


In order to get any semblance of pressure, I need to brew the espresso first. If I turn on the machine and let it warm up, and then try to steam first, I'll only get the odd bubble or two and then it sputters out. I get a steady stream of water if I turn on the brewing and steam switch though.

Coffee,raix3695,krsng0,"I have a cheap Mr. Coffee drip maker, is it worth it to buy an expensive coffee grinder?","I have been wanting to brew better coffee than the cheap coffee grounds I brew every morning, but since I do not have the equipment, I don't buy expensive coffee.

A friend gave me many bags of fine coffee beans and grinding these beans with a cheap blade grinder results in the same taste like the cheap grounds. I want to buy a burr grinder, but I am unsure if I would also need to buy a better coffee maker. Given this would be very expensive, I wanted to read your opinions.

I've cleaned it multiple times and the buzz still occurs. My research points to a dysfunctional solenoid, and recommends a replacement part that is very hard to find.  It's the Solenoid Valve assembly, and everywhere I look it's either sold out or back-ordered.  The part I need is two valves assembled together as a unit, attached to a plastic post, of sorts.  

Amazon sells a single solenoid.  I'm not sure if I should buy two of them and just clean the metal part that they attach to really well.  Or, should I attempt to clean the original component?

I looked into the Sage Smart Grinder Pro, but am not sure whether this is not a good product or overkill for what I'm after.

Coffee,tauhammerhead,krjhzb,Scientific comparison of Aeropress and Stovetop coffee,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 peopleâ€™s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought Iâ€™d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: Iâ€™m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isnâ€™t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear peopleâ€™s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609920351

Coffee,o_o_really,krheht,How does a coarse grind taste good with V60?,"Hey everyone,   
So I got a V60 for christmas and have been going wild with experimentation. I've mostly been following James Hoffmann's recipe but have also tried Scott Rao's and the 4:6 method. I recently tried some beans from a friend where the head roaster recommended a coarse grind, 1:13 ratio, aiming for a brew time of 2 minutes. I thought, this must be a mistake, because every recipe I've found calls for medium-fine grind setting. I figured, the roaster must know these beans better than anyone else, so let's try it out. To my surprise, it was amazing. I was blown away by the brightness from the cup yet it tasted balanced and not overly acidic. I then for kicks brewed the beans with the James Hoffmann method and ratio and it tasted awful. I feel like this roasters method breaks everything I've learned about V60's so far. Is it the low ratio that makes the coarse grind work? What science behind this am I not getting?",1609911464
Coffee,polame,krh5sm,Dialing in Lactic Acid fermentation coffee,"Hello everyone, 

I recently received a bag of the Lactic Acid fermentation coffee from Black and White roasters (https://www.blackwhiteroasters.com/collections/all-things-coffee/products/julio-bermudez-lactic). It is currently on week 3 after roast and I am having trouble dialing it in. I am using the newer JX Pro (Grey Dot) at a 33 setting - 3 rotations and 3 numbers and a Hario Switch. My grinderâ€™s zero is at 2, so technically I am at 3 rotations and 1 number in reality. I am following the Hoffmann recipe of 15g to 250g boiling water, 2 min steep, stir, 15 sec pause after stirring and drawdown. I have the untabbed Hario filters and am getting a slightly less than one minute drawdown. The aroma of the coffee is straight up raspberry, but the cup tastes rather one dimensional. I tried going two clicks finer and hit that wall of bitterness. Any tips in helping me dial in the coffee more? Should I go slightly coarser?

Just a few months ago I finally got a coffee maker and started making brewed coffee. I just use the cheap 5 dollar kroger generic brand coffee. I live in vegas where we have hard water with lots of chlorine and I just use the tap water to make my coffee. 

Sometimes I notice, usually on my second cup, that when I go to take a sip I get a smell of like a barnyard or sweat. It seems like it floats to the top of the coffee and sits on the top so if I stir it or drink the ikcky top layer it kind of goes away. 

Recently I read a reddit comment from someone who lives in Seattle and they said they lived between some wholesale coffee bean factories and it would all produce a manure like smell especially in the morning. 

Is there some way to avoid all this? Better quality coffee or some kind of cleaning/filtering?",1609909352

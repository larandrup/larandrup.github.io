Coffee,andcarro,l7s53j,Monogram Coffee Appreciation Post,"My wife and I have always been into coffee (or - we thought we were into coffee). We typically would seek out local roasters, and we had tried a couple of subscription boxes but never been terribly impressed.

On Black Friday 2020, Monogram was having a special - 50% off of your first two subscription orders. I was a little skeptical - it was committing to a decent amount of coffee, and it's not inexpensive (though it's certainly not extraordinarily so, especially for subscription savings).

I wasn't going to buy - but the owner of Monogram was in the Black Friday Deal Thread, and seemed like a really nice person - so I pulled the trigger on two subscriptions - 6 bags each of the roasters choice and classic filter. We gave a couple of bags as gifts where we got duplicates, but kept 8 bags for ourselves and stored unopened in individual airtight containers to do our best to keep quality up to the extent possible.

The result? An entirely new appreciation for different coffees. The quality of the coffees far exceeds that of local roasters I have access to (though I'll still support them). Each coffee genuinely felt like an experience. 

My favorite was the Karogoto AA - my wife is devastated it's not currently available to order more. Her favorite coffee she has ever had.

As we are finishing our last bag now, it's the Luz Marina Quintero. I often see tasting notes on bags, and really don't see the follow through or ""get"" them. This is a lighter bodied and complex tasting coffee, and the notes of yogurt and black cherry are absolutely spot on. It's opened us up to trying more. It's not feasible for us to order daily drivers from Monogram, but if you have the means and haven't tried them - I could not recommend them more highly.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with Monogram - I just wanted to encourage others to try it as they've changed the way we view coffee in my house.",1611925808

Coffee,Quirky-Dimension-499,l7qf7v,Brewing pour-over with low doses,"When I really started to get into coffee about a year ago, I found that I wanted to punctuate my day more often with the break that making a pour-over provides - especially now I'm working from home.

I realised that brewing with 20g(ish) every time I wanted a coffee was a lot of caffeine, and decaf can be good but its taste is generally not as good as 'normal coffee'.

So my question is: **Do you have a pour-over recipe using 10g(ish) that you like?**

Here's my current recipe (vaguely inspired by Tetsu and April)

\- coarse grind (traditional French press size), 10g light (or light-medium) roast

\- water straight off the boil

\- 25g bloom (drain through completely), 50g pour (then 45 seconds), take the total water up to 160g with one slowish pour.

Doesn't take long to drain through overall, and it's a very clear cup of coffee - good acidity and sweetness - not a lot of body, that's how I like it.

Coffee,Comprehensive_Low860,l7of3g,[Help] I need to know the difference in quality between a Milk Frother and a Milk Steamer.,"So I´ve recently (6 days ago) bought an espresso machine, including a milk steamer. Not the wand-type , but a seperate container I can pour milk into and the machine will steam it into my cup. After only 6 days, the machine let bubbles of air get into it and the steaming process now results in me just getting  warmed milk into my cup, with barely any foam. One of my friends has an Aerochino (Nespresso´s milk frother). I borrowed it yesterday, and it produces very thick, textured foam. I´ve read that the ¨true latte and cappuchinos¨ are made with ¨microtextures¨ (?). I consider myself relatively into coffee, but not a snob. My question is: what is the general adittude towards using a milk frother instead of a milk steamer in order to make cappuccino and latte, and what do you think has a better taste/experience. I´m now considering buying a Sage Barista Touch Pro (including a milk wand), replacing my current machine, or getting a 70 euro Nespresso Aerochino to replace the whacky milkgenerator on my current machine with.

Coffee,howdy_bc,l7ive9,"Is manually prepared coffee all that different from instant coffee, or am I crazy?","I've always drunk instant coffee all my life. Coffee culture is not a thing, really, in India, (we have the best tea, though) and most of us prepare instant coffee at home. (It's ridiculously cheap; a sachet costs ₹2 ($0.027) and makes a large mug of coffee. Hard to beat.)

I've been lurking this sub for a while, decided to give it a shot. Bought coffee beans, we already had a grinder, and made coffee with manual methods I found online. Things I tried:

Cowboy coffe (with grounds put in from the start).

Cowboy coffe (with grounds put in after the water is hot).

Pour over coffee, with filter paper.

I gotta be honest, I don't taste much of a difference? These three methods had only a slight difference in taste from each other (pour over being the best), and taste pretty much identical to the instant coffee we get in stores. The only noticeable difference is in the aftertaste: this coffee leaves a stronger aftertaste in the mouth compared to instant coffee. I do like that.

Is this normal? Should I really buy a coffee machine or french press? Will there be a substantial difference, or is it just super subtle? I want to have better coffee, but I feel like I'm going crazy.

P.S. The coffees we get in cafeterias are pretty shit. Instant coffee in 100% milk tastes better. So I have no frame of reference either, other than the vividly snobby blogs online and the coffee I've made myself in the past.

I was reading online different ratios people were using, I read a common one is 1:4 ratio of coffee to water. Seemed pretty simple to me so I put a 1 cup of coarse ground coffee i ground at the store into 4 cups of cold water and I’m now finding out these ratios apply to the beans pre-grind. Most also refer to things in weight rather than volume and I do not have a food scale so I’m pretty clueless as to what I’m going to get as a final product. Will it need to be diluted or am I brewing a super weak cold brew? I could not find much for ratios in volume or post grind, I don’t have a grinder at home either so I don’t have the advantage of measuring out my beans on the spot.",1611891433
Coffee,theledman,l7hyl3,[Gear][Video] Turn your Baratza Encore/Virtuoso into a zero retention grinder with 3D printing,"I recently purchased the Virtuoso+ which I love but got really tired of smacking and shaking it to get all the grounds out. Sometimes it retains up to 2g of coffee which is a lot when you're only grinding 15g (or annoying when you want to change up your beans if you single dose).

Anyway, I saw [this trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWdcqAEkRgg) which worked really well by forcing air through the grinder to blow all the grounds out. I didn't like how loud it was, especially in the morning, so I designed and 3D printed a bellows attachment that fits between the lid and hopper that allows you to pump more air silently through your grinder and completely empty the grind chamber. Added bonus is that it blows all the chaff out too so it's useful as a cleaning tool.

Here are my constraints:

* Price under $1,200.
* I don't want to use pods.
* Not too big in either width or hight. (I don't have much counter space, and I would like it to go under one of my cabinets if possible.)

Coffee,MattMugiwara,l790qy,Am I crazy? I need some help choosing entry-level equipment.,"Hello everyone, I've been lurking in here for a few days already and I have to say I am enjoying it a lot. I really like how you folks are quite accepting of simple questions from noobs and that's something that's encouraging me to post. 

I would like some help with choosing entry level equipment because it's time for me to start drinking good coffee.

Some background: I've always drank large amounts of coffee, always with a small amount of milk and more sugar than I would like to admit. I would always smoke when drinking which made me be fine with the quality and not worry too much? I have also never ground a coffee bean, I would always get pre-ground coffee, torrefacto/arabica mixture, whatever came my way. I have used a Moka pot for years, then just a cheap drip machine, and for the last 4 or 5 years, a french press which I took quite a liking to (been using the James Hoffmann technique for some months). 
However, I have always enjoyed espressos and lattes from commercial settings, I have worked at bars and learned the basics of pulling a nice shot, controlling the grind a bit, making sure that the coffee fell in a nice way as an indicator of quality, detecting when it was off by taste, etc. 

I always told myself that I was saving ""the good coffee"" for when I quitted smoking and that has recently happened (&gt;2 weeks going strong!). I've upped the amount of coffee I put in my french press and significantly lowered the sugar. The result is that I think I like other methods better? I still remember coffee from espresso machines quite fondly, and when I try to drink the french press without sugar, I don't like it. I guess it's because I'm using bad, stale pre-ground coffee and whatnot, so I'd like to still try french press and aeropress methods with good, freshly ground coffe and see how I like them.

So I am aiming to get a good grinder and most likely a decent home espresso machine. Now, I know that it could be a bit crazy because I'm quite new to the entire world, but given the aforementioned experience I think I would definitely like it. However, I don't wanna get super into modding machines, replacing parts, etc etc. At least not yet. 

I am torn between a few options:

For grinders, I've seen a lot of praise for the Wilfa Svart (145 CHF) but the [page where I'd buy it (local coffee equipment shop)](https://adrianos.ch/shop/maschinen/kaffeemuehlen/wilfa-svart-aroma) says that it isn't suitable for espresso? I haven't seen this in comments in here, is it true? Because I think that would rule it out for me, right?

The other options I was considering are the [Sage (Breville in the US I think) the Dose Control Pro, for 162 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Coffee-grinders/SAGE-The-Dose-Control-Pro-Silver-p568447), or the [Lelit Fred, for 177 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Coffee-grinders/LELIT-Fred-PL043MMI-p478287?selsort=rd) since it also seems to be a good brand. I don't wanna go too high on price since I'm still looking for something entry-level, and above 200 CHF is I think way too much (a Baratza Encore is 255.- for example, since I know it's another common recommendation around here). What do you think? Would you recommend any of those for my purposes? Any other recommendations that are worth checking out at this range? I'm purchasing from Switzerland.

For the espresso machine itself, I think I am quite sold on a [Sage the Bambino Plus for 309 CHF](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/sage-the-bambino-plus-espresso-machines-12009447?pcscpId=1&amp;utm_source=toppreise&amp;utm_campaign=preisvergleich&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=12009447). I watched James Hoffmann video comparing it to some others and I think it matches my needs quite well? Specially since he mentioned it being entry-level for people that don't wanna tinker _too much_. The Gaggia Classic (450 CHF) and Rancilio Silvia (800 CHF???) are out of my budget and I also don't like the extra needed tinkering. I read a few reviews from [uk coffee blog](https://coffeeblog.co.uk/sage-bambino-plus-coffee-machine-review/) and while the guy seems extremely positive (maybe biased?) towards it, I liked how it looks. The only other feasible option (from the machines I know which aren't many) would be a [Lelit Anna for 379 CHF](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s2/product/lelit-anna-espresso-machines-8702068?pcscpId=3&amp;utm_source=toppreise&amp;utm_campaign=preisvergleich&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=8702068) which is again getting a bit too high for my budget. Furthermore, in the video the steamer from the Bambino was praised in comparison to the others, and I think that milk drinks will still be an important part of my repertoire.

As a last/other option, I could buy a [Sage The Barista Express for 449 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Espresso-machines/SAGE-The-Barista-Express-Brushed-Stainless-Steel-p565801), but it is my (maybe wrong) understanding that it's better to have the grinder and the espresso machine separated? and it wouldn't be that much cheaper, only 22 bucks. The only benefit I see is that the Barista uses 15 bars as opposed to the Bambino's 9 bars, but from what I've read you need way better equipment and technical expertise to take full advantage of the 15 bars, and for my level 9 bars would be actually better. It might be completely wrong, but again I enjoyed the uk coffee blog article about it. Whaat do you think? Any other suggestions to check out?

Sorry for the lengthy post, but I am really thankful for your answers and help! Cheers!",1611868380

I've been dabbling in more advanced coffee prep for a while now and I can say I have certainly upped my game and have been able to get superior (to my taste) cups of coffee compared to before. I have almost exclusively used a press since I was 15 and 8 years later (this year) bought a reusable single cup pour over contraption (which I don't like too much because it seems to get clogged a lot). I wouldn't say that I'm a hobbyist, but I do take my prep more seriously compared to my friends. My issue with the pour over, even using a scale has been consistency, which may have  to do with the clogging.

The thing is, this weekend I went to a cottage and for the hell of it tried out the drip coffee machine (Mid-tier Hamilton Beach). To my surprise, I got a great cup of coffee every single time. I'd say on a 1 to 10 scale of my own prep (10 being the best coffee I have ever made), it gave about an 8.5-9. Now I am someone who likes generally likes picking up skills and being challenged, but I can't say that I love it as much on a day to day basis if I can get 90% of what I want with no effort.

So I guess my question is: Can a reasonably priced drip machine be a good choice for day to day usage and reserve the pour over for nicer beans on the weekend when I have the time and will to have the experience or was my experience just blind luck and I should just work on my technique more?",1611862871

Coffee,CThiefUK,l71am1,Unable to choke up my machine!,"OK, I know that's not normally what you want to do, but I'm confused!

I bought us a Breville Mini Barista (Sunbeam mini in other regions I think) for Christmas and have been experimenting with it since then.

No matter how fine I grind the beans, or how hard I tamp (or combination of the above), I cannot choke the machine up!  My espresso shots are always around 17-18 seconds from first sign of liquid until the pump stops and I can't get it to run any longer whatever I do.

I'm using the double (pressurised) basket that came with the machine in case that makes any difference. I bought a Gaggia-compatible 58mm basket to try instead of the pressurised one but despite fitting into the portafilter, the portafilter won't fit into the machine as the basket is slightly too high around the rim :(

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why I can't get a longer shot from this machine?

Also the crema that comes out is quite biscuit coloured rather than brown-red and is frothy too.

I'm struggling to find a replacement basket that fits at the moment...

Thanks!",1611851154

Coffee,CreditCardChase,l70w06,"What’s more important, brew ratio or brew time?","For the past few years of my coffee journey I’ve relied on brew ratio to tell me when I’m done brewing. 30g:500g pourover? My grind size could be off and my brew is taking 5min but I won’t remove the brewer from the carafe until it’s drained through. 16g:32g espresso? My grind size could be off and I’ve hit 32g in 20sec but I’ll still turn off the pump. 

But, lately I’ve been experimenting with prioritizing brew time instead. 3.5min into pourover and there’s still liquid draining through the brewer? Pull the brewer off, I’m drinking a stronger ratio today. 30sec into an espresso pull and I only have half my target yield? Stop the pump, I guess I’m having a ristretto.

I’ve only been toying around with this for the past week but it’s drastically improved what would have been “bad” cups. Of course, ideally I’d hit 30:500 in 3.5min for my pourovers and I’ll adjust my grind to hit that next time, but for my last few pourovers 30:400 in 3.5min has tasted significantly better than 30:500 in 4.5min. Same experience for espresso.

Anyone else do this? Is this actually not that contrary to popular wisdom?",1611850307

Coffee,preciousish,l6yzvu,Brew Scales as General Kitchen Scales,"Hi folks, 

I currently have a credit note for a coffee supply store that I need to use and I saw their range of Brewing Scales, for example the Hario V60 Drip Scales. I'm wondering if these types of scales are versatile enough for me to use them for other kitchen needs like baking.

As much as I love coffee I can't drink it (thanks for nothing, kidneys), I was using the coffee site to buy a kettle (thanks for nothing, Brewista)....so a set of scales that only serve coffee-making would be lost on me.

The website descriptions only talk about measuring beans and timing your brew etc, but nothing to really say that I couldn't use it to measure flour, seeds, butter etc.

I don't need any fancy features for my cooking, just thought I might take the opportunity to upgrade my current digital kitchen scale while I have this credit.

Coffee,ThatGuyAustin7,l6yea5,Immersion Forgiveness,"Recently, I've been using the Tim Wimbledoe aeropress recipe as opposed to my usual v60 brew. Since I was using a medium-dark roast, the only difference was my grind being coarser than his recommendation (14 on baratza encore rather than 8-12) but I didn't expect the level at which an immersion brew would be forgiving compared to a percolation brew.

I got distracted this morning and instead of letting the slurry sit for 1 minute before pressing, I let it go for 2, which I expected to double the extraction and pull out some very undesired flavors. I didn't have time to complain though, so I threw in a splash of cream and went out the door. But when I finally brought myself to take a sip, I was pleasantly surprised that while it was definitely stronger, there was nothing unpleasant about it. I think I actually prefer it this way for the coffee I'm using (Loyal Coffee Columbia #77).

I've had my fair share of surprises for the past year or so since I've gotten into this hobby, but this one really caught me off guard. It makes me want even more than before to pick up a clever dripper to add to my ever-growing collection.",1611845068

Coffee,bohemian03,l6tivq,Upgrade from Hario Mini Mill - 1Zpresso or Timemore?,"Hello, 

I've recently purchased a V60 and I think it's time to upgrade my manual burr grinder as well. My budget is around 100 EUR and upon research, it seems like 1Zpresso or the Timemore are the best options for my budget. However, each brand has so many different models and series and I was wondering if someone could point me to which brand and model would be best.

My daily driver is the V60 and usually only make coffee for myself (15g). But sometimes, I'd like to make for two people (30g). In addition to the V60, I own an Aeropress and a Moka Pot that I might want to use time to time.

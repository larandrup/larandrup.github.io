tea,Co32_,kusd4q,Help us get back into Tea!,Hi! A little context/background to this post to begin with: My Father and I have always enjoyed our fair share of tea and coffee beverages and back in the old days (crazy to say that) we started drinking tea quite avidly and we were introduced to the chain tea store tea-vanna we were hooked and bought all the gear and bags and tried a lot up until they went out of business. Ever since that time we have been surviving off of loose and bagged teas from grocery stores. With that said appreciating and drinking teas with my father was always a great bonding experience and one i would like to enjoy again. So if any of y‚Äôall have general advice on where you buy teas of better quality and variety online and just how to get started in this vast community any information would be greatly appreciated! Have a lovely day.,1610329449

Love a certain company's wildberry tea.  Unfortunately very few local shops carry it.  As well, the packaging (1 tin for 20 sachets) make the tree hugger in me cringe.

Tried some of another company's &lt;insert common English first name here&gt; equivalent over the holidays.  Tasty.  And bloody expensive ...

Ideally something I could buy loose in bulk and throw in a diffuser ball thingy.  Yup, I really know tea :D

Oh, and no affiliation with Nestle.

Any tips?

TIA :)

tea,Zycrus,kuehaf,Bancha Goishicha from What-Cha,"Japan is mostly famous for their green teas. So I was intrigued when i found out that there is more than green tea from japan has to offer. I looked for some time to get my hand on some Goishicha, which is a japanese Heicha made from bancha leaves. It goes through two fermentation processes and is pressed and cut into small square bricks.

https://preview.redd.it/87tjwgy9xha61.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6952622ab3265805631701e585e6f682b479e2bc

This tea is quite rare, even in japan. So rare, that for some time only one producer was left until the local goverment stepped in with support. So I was quite happy when I found this tea offered at the EU based vendor What-Cha. This way I could avoid problems with german customs. If somebody is interested in more details about the processing of this tea, you can check out this link: [https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha](https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha)

Upon opening the bag of this tea I was treated with a very strong and unfamiliar smell. It is very hard to discribe, because it is something completly different to other teas and tea types. It has strong fermented notes but coupled with a strong acidic tone to it. It is really unique and interesting but defnetly not something I would like to smell all day. For steeping I heated up my water to boiling temeperature an placed one brick in my 160ml Kyusu and rinsed the tea first. The wet leaves loose their strong smell a bit. The same notes are still there but turned down a bit and coupled with a little sweetness. For my first steep I started with five minutes as recomended by What-Cha

*Processing img dbkjb7mu2ia61...*

*Processing img jr0wxd0x2ia61...*

The color of the liquid is red- brownish orange a bit like amber and smells like the wet leaves but toned down.

The taste was quite a surprise, because it has a strong molass, licorice sweetness. Fermented notes like mushrooms are there but they are not so prominent as in other fermented teas like ripe Pu Erh. It also has a some acidity like a lemon based sourness. This acidity is there but it is not overwhelming the other tasting notes and it gives the tea and its sweetness an interresting kick. For my part I like the little sourness but I can imagine, that some people dont. So for my second infusion I agian brewed the tea with boiling water for five minutes but placed the liquid in the fridge for half an hour until it was cold. I read that this would nullify or heavily turn down the acidity of the tea and it worked. The cold tea kept its sweetness and fermented notes but lacked the acidity nearly completly.

So this is a very unique tea and definitely completly different to any other fermented teas I had in the past. I would definitely recomend to try out this style tea and enjoy it with loved ones for special occasions.",1610285402

I tend to use about 3 and half table spoonfuls for about 400ml of water. For fukamushi this seems maybe a too much. I go for one brew method, brew once and be done with the leaves.

I have done like 3 topics about Fukujirushi, or mentioned about my struggles to brew it. I still had only one good steep from it, where the taste was bitter free, very thick taste, and just overall great cup. After that, i havent come nowhere close to that. I had couple of other problem teas too. Basically, what always or 90% time works well, are cheaper Senchas, and Gyokuros. Baaically everything between seems to end up disappointing.

First brew. No sugar.  
100ml Gaiwan and half the amount in the tin (I don‚Äôt have a scale. Sorry.)
Scent is orchid and jasmine like
Brew is a very light green and the scent is grassy
Fairly basic green tea taste. Thick feeling in the mouth. Flowery perfume lingers in the throat. Simple, but pleasant. Not buttery. Leaves have a scent of cut clover flowers

Second steep. 
Deeper green, about the same as the first steep otherwise. Leaves are still opening. 

Third steep + four pieces of rock sugar. Using approx 70ml from now on. 
Yet again little change, there is now a slightly toasted taste which is pleasant. 

Fourth steep + three more small sugars. Two minutes. 
More of a yellow color now. Floral scent is gone. Very sweet taste, not as thick and not buttery. The floral scent from earlier is in this steep even though it‚Äôs scent is gone. Not as toasted as the last until it cools some. Largely the same. I almost want it to have toasted rice in it. 

Fifth steep + 1 sugar
Three minutes
Not as pleasant. Feels thin and very one note. This one will go to my orchids. 

Sixth steep + 4 sugar 
Three and a half minutes 
Only has a bit of sweetness from the sugar. Not that pleasant either, though I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. The rest of this is for orchids.",1610216351

I m a bit puzzled by the instructions on my Iwachu cast iron teapot. It says it can be used as a kettle, it has no enamel. But it also comes with a drainer, if one wants to use it as a teapot. That's what I ve done so far, without asking myself any questions (I got this teapot as a gift, I m new here), I even brew rooibos. It retains the smells a little beat but honestly I can't taste it in the tea. Do you recommend using another device to brew such as a kyusu (I like sencha so I m not sure about a gaiwan), and why?

tea,philantrophe,kjvjbl,[HELP PLEASE] Matcha only tastes amazing in ice cream.,"Matcha has always been one of my favorite ice cream flavors. As in skid the ice cream with the side of a spoon enough to barely coat the brim and savor every last bite good. Matcha tea on the other hand is an entirely different story. 

I had recently acquired ceremonial grade matcha and was excited to try it. A pleasantly sweet aroma echoed into the air as the tin was opened. I followed tutorials online to make sure it was prepared correctly. (water temperature, whisking motions, sifting the powder etc.) A fluorescent green foamy drink sat in front of me and I was eager to try it.  Yet I ended up being disappointed on how the taste came out. It was just bitter water. A different kind of bitter from premium/culinary grade matcha but it wasn't as satisfying as I would like. The experience reminded of coffee(another flavour that only tastes good in ice cream). Just a different iteration of bitter water. I don't think it was the milk or sugar that makes matcha in ice cream delicious as trying matcha tea with those doesn't yield favourable results.

So I'm currently wondering: Is the temperature of ice cream the deciding factor that allows me to enjoy matcha? Can I not enjoy matcha unless it's cold enough to omit the unpleasant flavors? And how exactly does temperature impact the taste of matcha?

The change in variance of flavour from tradiational matcha to matcha ice cream has left me feeling conflicted. Does this make me a ""fake fan"" of matcha as I don't like it served in its traditional form?

tea,day_break,kjq3xt,Lapsang Store Samples Part 1,"This is part 1 of me trying samples I got at [Lapsang Store](https://lapsangstore.com/collections/sample-pack/products/10-flavors-zheng-shan-tang-black-tea-mini-pack-collection). I brewed 1 tea a day and did brews in triplets. 

Jin Jun Mei

9/10 - 12 infusions

This is the real thing. Rose water, chocolate, lightly fruity, and a hint of honeysuckle. early infusions are marked by chocolate with infusions 5-9 being distinctly woody. the later infusions become sweeter with the honeysuckle shining through. I stopped at 12 infusions but it could probably go 2 more. this tea also surprisingly mellow for Jin Jun Mei, I felt very relaxed much like being in a very soft beanbag? I think that is how I would describe the feel of the tea. very luxurious beanbag while snacking on chocolates.

&amp;#x200B;

Fei Zi Xiao(Smile of Princess)

8.5/10 - 12 infusions

Reminds me of glacier melt I had in the Canadian Rockies. Crisp, rocky, and cooling(not like dancong cooling though). It has a very incorporated water taste which gives it a very unique character and permeates all of the steeps while different aspects of litchi come and go. This is a lot like I would guess an unsmoked lapsang souchong would taste if I had only had the smoked version. litchi is the primary flavor of the tea but it changes from more of an aroma to a more tangible taste the more you dig into the tea. I would like to note that this tea is not very sweet at the start but the aftertaste does have a distinct sweetness.

&amp;#x200B;

Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong

9.5/10 - 15 infusions

everything you want from a Lapsang Souchong and more. Classic smokey flavor with dried longans with added hot-chocolate; I would have expected to like this combination at a glance but it works so well. Perfect for snow-days and keeps you feeling warm for hours with a subtle lingering sweetness. I wish I could say more but smoked Lapsang Souchong tends to be a two note tea and this one has a wonderful 3rd note that puts it above the norm. I ended up trying brews 15-18 and they still had flavor but were lacking enough that I would say 15 infusions is a good place to stop judging the tea.

&amp;#x200B;

Aged Fir Narcissus

7.5/10 - 10 infusions

When I opened the sample and smelled it, I said ""that's definitely Jin Jun Mei."" This tea shares a lot of those characteristics such as the long sweet aftertaste and chocolate and floral notes but is distinctly different. It is a lot earthier overall while Jin Jun Mei is more light and floral. There is a nice cinnamon note in the first couple infusions and a marzipan note later on. I also picked up a consistent lemon flavor throughout the tea but it was really hard for me to place until I smelled the leaves once I was done with all infusions, because there is no sour or acidic flavor to this tea the lemon was surprising. Overall a solid tea but it lacked solidity in the flavor notes that the other teas possessed. For example, while I could definitely taste marzipan on brews 7-9 it never really held together between sips and left me wanting more but never delivering. Very unique flavors and definitely a tea worth trying if you are interesting in getting into Jin Jun Mei but prefer earthier flavors over the lighter floral ones that the traditional Jin Jun Mei offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Shui Di Xiang

7.5/10 - 12 infusions

This tea was described as ""unique water fragrance"" but I would classify it more as litchi, blackberry, huckleberry. This tea is solidly fruity, a lot of teas are described as such while having light notes of fruit but this one the fruit is out and on display. The background notes are chocolatey and earthy with a small amount of burnt caramel that comes out more in later infusions. these combination of background notes bring a smooth body to the tea while the fruity and tart notes up front keep your mouth watery; a very interesting combination that I enjoyed. unfortunately the tea did not offer much in terms of lasting flavors as they dissipated within a few minutes of drinking. side note: this is the first tea out of the 5 that had a twig in it, the rest have been purely leaf and/or bud. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts so far: fantastic teas. I have not sampled a place before that has had this level of consistency in teas. I will definitely be picking up some of the Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong as this tea really stood out. I got a couple more samples of Jin Jun Mei from other sources coming in so I will wait to try those. Only real downside to this place that I have seen in the first half is that they only offer black teas so its not a place I can solely get my teas from.",1608857049

tea,fish85963,kjma0c,Chinese gyokuro tea. No flavour?,"So I've recently started buying loose green tea from a respected vendor around here. I picked up some sencha fukujyu, it tasted great and got stronger with each brew(4g, 250ml water 80c, 2-3 mins). But when it comes to the gyokuro, I tried brewing it at 60c 1.5 mins, then another attempt at 3 mins, then another at 70c. It seems to have very limited taste, what am I missing or what is the appeal with this tea? All the other opinions I've heard about it are that it's their favourite tea, tastes fantastic etc. For me it tastes like warm water with a hint of standard green tea flavour, although it does feel a bit fuller. Any tips? Thanks",1608841901
tea,ArtherAnderson,kjm2b4,I was gifted a box of jasmine green and a box of white/green tea. But the box suggests sleeping at 200¬∞ which seems too high. Should I listen to the box?,,1608841146

tea,DelkorAlreadyTaken,lsdeib,Price comparison tea vs coffee,"Hey, I want to put our tea expenditures into perspective for those of us who not only drink tea but also coffee.

Let's say you brew gong fu style and use on average 5g tealeaves per litre of water. That will lead to 200 litres of tea per 1kg of leaves. Assuming a very budget friendly tea of 50‚Ç¨/kg (my current somewhat daily drinker tie guan yin costs as much) that will leave us with a cost/litre of 25 cents.

Now onto coffee: let's say you use pour-over style brewing and use 50g coffee per 1 litre of water (I am not a coffee expert but I heard that pros even use 60g/litre for pour-over, so 50g should be reasonable). This means we can achieve 20 litres of finished coffee from 1kg of beans.  
Assuming a kg of cheap supermarket coffee (in Germany, so maybe your prices vary) of 6‚Ç¨/kg, that leaves us with a price / litre of 30 cents.

tl;dr tea is way cheaper than coffee",1614278076

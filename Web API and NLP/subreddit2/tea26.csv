I mostly shop on YS, and sometimes it's confusing for me when I see multiple entries for the same tea, for example Mi Lan Xiang. 

Usually I just look at the price and assume the quality. This is now the 3rd time I've ordered Mi Lan Xiang. This batch seems much flatter. I mean it's still good, and it still feels like Mi Lan Xiang, but it isn't as fruity or floral. Sometimes I wonder if it's just my head and something about expectations. I remember the first time I tasted Mi Lan Xiang (first order of Chinese tea) and thinking ""I LOVE CHINESE TEA!""

tea,ProbablyNotPoisonous,kgok0s,Can't seem to find the sweet spot for oolongs,"My oolongs smell wonderful, but they either taste like nothing or get bitter.

I have five different oolongs from Song Tea. I'm using Absopure brand spring water to brew them. I've tried following the instructions for tea amount, time, and temp; short gaiwan steeping with lots of leaf; hotter water; cooler water; short steeps; long steeps; increasing steeping time; keeping steeping time the same over multiple steeps; using a teapot; using an IngenuiTea. Nothing seems to bring out any actual flavor except bitter, and then a faint sweet aftertaste.

I use a Cuisinart electric kettle to heat the water. The teas all have suggested brewing temps of 205 or 208 F, but the kettle has 200 and Boil settings with nothing in between. I've tried using the Boil setting and pouring the water into another container before pouring it over the leaves, and I've tried just using the 200 setting. I've also tried Boil straight from the kettle in the name of experimentation. Which setting I use doesn't seem to make nearly as much difference as steep time, but in any case my tea is either flavorless or bitter. None of the fruit/cocoa/molasses/whatever notes the package claims - although, like I said, they *smell* wonderful and distinct.

I thought maybe smell was actually all there was to it, and then I tried some wild tree purple tea from Yunnan Sourcing and was blown away by how it tasted (and posted here about it a short while back). Intense dark fruit, wood, and honey notes with an unreal sweet finish. So either there's a *drastic* difference between black and oolong, or else I'm brewing it wrong, somehow.

How do I figure this out?",1608442804

When younger and trying to reduce sugar intake, soda, etc, I used to think adding honey also added the flavor of honey and was a win-win. Two good flavors in one cup, so better than sugar.  But recently I’m finding that it makes the tea bland. Can’t fully taste the tea OR honey. And they both taste fine on their own. I actually just used this to my advantage, I tried some tea that I was a bit iffy on the flavor. After honey, the iffy flavor is gone.


A few years ago I had a pretty bad flu/cold that nuked my sense of taste and smell and I’m not sure if I’m back to 100% or not. So I thought I’d ask people to see if it’s just a me problem.

Most people don't drink tea for the caffeine content. I personally don't but I do enjoy a good boost of caffeine. My idea while most defiantly terrible is to put a large amount say 6-10 maybe more teabags in one cup let it steep and then use this super concentrated concoction as a kind of quick way to make tea. I can heat up a mug of water pour in a small amount of my concentrated tea and I have tea quickly and easily with possibly a higher caffeine content skipping the whole steeping process(a process that takes no more than 5 minutes). Now this is a terrible idea but thats often the most fun kind of idea so I am going to do it. I will make an update post on my findings into this venture. Its very possible no one will care and at most two people will see this and be like ""ha loser"" but nevertheless life has tempted me with the most delicious flavor of experience, a quite terrible idea and I intend to cease upon the opportunity presented by my quite terrible mind.

You can also talk about anything else on your mind, from your specific routine while making tea, or how you've been on an oolong kick lately. Feel free to link to pictures in here, as well.

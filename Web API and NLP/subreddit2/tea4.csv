tea,yrhumblenarrator,lnz69e,Why can't I make tea taste good?,"Hi guys, so first of all, let me tell you that I am completely new to brewing tea, but, nevertheless, i wanted to try it out!

So i figured i'd try to brew this Sencha green tea I had at home (it's loose leaf and it had like rose buds and strawberry) and it looked very nice so I was pretty excited.

The first time I brew it, it was very weak and it tasted kind of weird (I think I used too much water and i shouldn't have used tap water).

So second brewing, I used more tea and after I seeped it, it smelled heavenly. I was so happy!  But, unsurprisingly, the tea was soooo bitter. I legit couldnt drink it. I used way too much tea and I think the water was too hot. I also think I let it steep for too long.

So, third time's the charm, right? Nope. I used 2 grams of tea (one teaspoon) for 6 oz of water. Water was at 170F. I let it steep for around 2 minutes. And i was so sure it was going to taste good but, sadly, it was even worse than the first time. It literally tasted like water so i just squeezed some drops of lemon into it and now I have a weird hot lemonade.

&amp;#x200B;

Am i doing something wrong? Could it be the tea? I really just wanted some nice tea. Please help.",1613795348

tea,BlankVerse,ln1k2i,Cold Brew Tea brew time?,"I generally like my regular tea cold, and my herb teas hot. 

So I purchased some Lipton (yeah, I know) Cold Brew and Iced Tea bags. The instructions for the Iced Tea were pretty much what you'd expect. 

1. 4 cups of boiling water over 2 large tea bags 
2. brew for 3-5 minutes, then remove bags
3. sweeten to taste
4. Stir in 6 cups of ice cubes

Makes 2 quarts of very Liptony ice tea.

Now the instructions fir the cold brew confused me. I'd already read a bunch of posts here and on the internet about cold brewing tea. And they all say for cold brew use 1.5-2x the amount of tea leaves you'd use for hot tea, and steep for anywhere from 4-24 hours depending upon the tea.

First off the Lipton Cold Brew actually has less tea than the Iced Tea version (6.2g vs 7.1g).

Then the instructions say:

1) Pour 2 cups water over 2 tea bags

Cold water? Luke warm tap water?

2) Brew 3 minutes, stir, remove tea bags

3) Sweaten to taste, add ice.

Just 3 minutes!?

I tried that and although it was stronger than I expected, it was still fairly weak tea in my opinion.

So I thought what if I left the bags in longer. After 2 hours the tea was just about right. After 4 hours it was starting to taste a little bitter, but I continued. After 6 hours it was fairly bitter and strong, so I took out the bags. I now had cold tea that required lots of honey to sweeten. ;)

What is everyone else's experience with brewing cold brew tea and particularly Lipton Cold Brew?

----

What about other teas, especially herb teas. 

Just for fun I decided to make cold herb tea using the Iced Tea method above, using 2 quarts hot water over 8 random herb tea bags since 2 qt=8 cups. and then cooling. That turned out pretty strong and dominated by the ginger tea I included (but I did not mind that since I enjoy ginger tea). I liked the end result. It was tasty. Next time I might try 8 bags in 3 quarts to make it less strong. And maybe even actually cold brew in the refrigerator.

Any suggestions?",1613693688

tea,BioStore,lmd6zw,Herbal medicine,"Indigenous people worldwide, revere much of the natural world as sacred. And rely on its elements to ease many **health problemes**. For much of humankind, especially in the groves of africa, possessing plant knowledge, or having access to a person who did, made the difference between life and death. In fact, the majority of the world still relies on traditional medicine, and even in industrialized countries, folk remedies are still used to treat illness everyday.

It's not a surprise then, in these modern times with the growing options of **medical technology,** that there‚Äôs a rising movement to restore ancient plant-based healing practices. Having access to modern healthcare is not easy, costs are skyrocketing and the quality of medical care is degrading in developed countries, let alone the tird world, leading a large population to seek alternatives outside of the mainstream medical system. Herbal medicine might be a more accessible solution.

There are many different systems of traditional medicine, and the philosophy and practices of each are influenced by the prevailing conditions, and geographic area within which it first evolved. The commun property of all the systems is there emphasis on the equilibrium of the mind, body, and the environment. Generally, the focus is on the overall condition of the individual, rather than on the particular ailment or disease from which the patient is suffering, and the use of herbs is a core part of treatment.

Traditional Chinese medicine is an important example of how ancient knowledge is applied in a holistic approach. Treatments are based on a large view of the patient, expressed in terms of the balance of yin and yang. Yin represents the earth, cold, and femininity, whereas yang represents the sky, heat, and masculinity. The actions of yin and yang influence the interactions of the five elements composing the universe: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The practitioners seek to control the yin and yang levels and the energy through the body by making recourse to herbal remedies.

In modern days, the usage of **natural products** other than vitamins and minerals are the most commonly used alternative medicines, because they are widely perceived as natural, safe, more affordable, closely corresponding to the patient‚Äôs ideology and allaying concerns about the adverse effects of chemical (synthetic) medicines. They also satisfy a desire for more personalized health care. Furthermore herbal therapy increases when conventional medicine is ineffective in the treatment of disease, such as in advanced cancer and in the face of new infectious diseases.",1613620877

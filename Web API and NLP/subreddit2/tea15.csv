They have for black teas: Earl Grey, Lyons tea, Lapsang Souchong, Kenyan tea, Ceylon tea, Blue Berry Tea

I'm doing a big end of the year project on the history and culture of tea and decided to try a variety for ""research"". Today I bought some ripe pu'erh tea for the first time. They are packed into little cakes. I followed the instructions and boiled 8 ounces of water to 212 degrees and placed the unwrapped cake  in a Pyrex glass to steep. When I poured the water over it the first thing that hit me was... the smell. It smelled like horse manure. 

Let me explain- it's not a ""bad smell"". I used to volunteer at a horse ranch and the smell of manure and hay is familiar to me. I actually quite like the scent, it is very earthy. It was just unexpected. I had my mom smell it and she agreed.

I strained the leaves and took a sip. It was very strong but had a nice flavor. I drank my first cup very quickly. Several things I noted were:

1. It made my throat feel a little weird. Tight, I guess. Like the feeling you get when you're trying not to cry.
2. It made me dizzy. Not too bad but just a little out of it. I looked up what this was and learned about Cha Zui. I'm wondering if this is was it might be

In conclusion, I was wondering if this was an ordinary experience? Or perhaps I messed up brewing it or maybe the tea was simply not good?

Pretty new to loose leaf teas. I have quit coffee about a month ago and started drinking loose leaf, which I fell in love with and am sort of obsessed about right now... 

This may be a bit of a silly question but I was wondering if it's the case that more expensive teas are better? I found a very well-regarded store near my city that sells many quality Chinese teas. I then placed an order for a bunch of their teas, mostly sample sizes to try and narrow down what I like. Then I then stumbled upon another store from a different city in my province that sells a lot of the same teas, and in general almost all of their teas, twice as cheap. Like 50g of tea in the second store costs as much as 25g in the first. It's quite disappointing, but at the same time I wonder if there's a reason behind that. Both stores have very good reputations, especially the more expensive one. Would that also mean that their teas are higher quality?

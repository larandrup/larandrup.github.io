The Ceylon tea isn't bad, it just seems generally weak and doesn't have near the strong/robust/in-your-face flavors that I'm used to in restaurant chai. Simple Loose Leaf comes closer -- it's definitely more in-your-face, but is way too heavy on the ginger for my taste (it's closer to Starbucks chai).

Does anyone know any brands that are closer to the kind of chai I'd get in an indian restaurant?

After more than 3 weeks in this whole new world to me and 40 different samples of tea, I can call myself a teahead baby. Thanks again to everyone who helped me in the last 30 days with tips, suggestions, etc.

I tried 3 or 4 Taiwanese cultivars and I think I have my favorite - Qing Xin. In all of the Qing Xin oolongs and even one Qing Xin black tea from Shanlinxi I feel some really nice syrupy sweetness with fresh resin notes, which I absolutely love. I ditched sugar and any additives because of this sweet fragrance, I can almost feel the sweetness on my tongue. I never knew that there are so fragrant teas in the world. I'm glad that a bunch of people here suggested me to try some Taiwanese tea. Thank you all.

This oolong on the picture is my first high mountain oolong (the only high mountain tea was the Shanlinxi black) I had, but more importantly it is the first green oolong I tried from the samples. And I will be honest - it's not my favourite, even though it's one of the most expensive teas I currently have  (probably top3 with price $0.52/g). I'm definitely not disappointed, but I prefer the cheaper low altitude summer bug bitten teas to this. I probably sound blasphemous, but I feel it that way: more oxidised = warmer and sweeter (idk if it's always true). It's too green for me and it is very ""strong"" if that makes any sense for such light-colored liquor - I can feel very slight and almost non-existent bitterness with a little dryness after the 4th infusion. It is good though - the resin + honey smell is there, even though it's less fragrant it is much more complex than what I've tried before, and while I was drinking it I was thinking of oil? Could a tea be called oily? This doesn't sound right, but if you've tried a thicker vinegar it has the same ""oiliness"". As for the fragrance I can feel more green notes like steamed spinach and this time some pine needles, rosmary needles... this kind of freshness (I find pine needles similar to resin for some reason). Anyway, my imagination is too wild as my main hobby is cooking so I relate everything to food for some reason. Anyway, It's very good, I enjoyed it a lot and it remained strong, aromatic and tasty for 12 infusions, really long lasting tea and overall I can give it 8/10, but I will probably not buy it again as it's expensive. But I will look for more oxidised versions of this Longfengxia Qing Xin for sure.

Have you ever tried this one? I didn't find much info for it. I think that it's not that famous, but I'm glad I tried it. As always I'm open to suggestions for other green oolongs to try because now I'm intrigued even though I prefer the darker ones. Are there any baked/roasted green oolongs or when you bake it, it's no longer green? Probably silly question, sorry :D I'm still learning the different teas and how they are made. The description of this particular green oolong says ""baking level: none"". How is it so green then (you know enzymes and things like this)? Steamed? So there should be baked green oolongs just like the roasted green teas! Anyways, I will stop thinking ""out loud"" and I will wait for someone more knowledgeable than me to explain.

I've tested negative for COVID-19, and my doctor is confident it will go away with time. I would like to alleviate the cough as much as possible before I start to feel better, and tea is something my friends have suggested. 

The problem: I've hated tea my entire 28 years. I'm a generally annoying, picky person when it comes to drinks, but I would love to be a Tea Person. Even if I didn't have this cough, I still want to love tea. 

I'm so boring. I generally only drink water and Pink Drinks or Hot Mochas from Starbucks. I don't like intense flavors most of the time. I don't like my stepmom's iced sun tea, or the hot chai tea and iced black tea my friends have offered me. I definitely need sweetness, but trying a southern iced black tea from my friend was like drinking liquid sugar. 

Flavor likes: Strawberry, honey, lemon, mint, chocolate, walnut, hazelnut
Flavor dislikes: Intense flavors, flavors that feel like I'm drinking a lawn, Starbucks chai
* I would prefer hot teas, and for some reason a creamier (more coffee-like) thickness appeals to me

I know just trying different ones will help me lead to a tea I fall in love with, but I'm hung up on being worried I'll waste tea if I don't end up liking it. I hate wasting food or drinks, and I don't want to let my friends down with my pickiness.

I bought myself a mint chocolate tea last holiday season. It is the first and only tea I have ever bought for myself and if I put 3 spoons of milk and sugar in it... it's passable. But I still haven't finished even half the box which was probably only 20 or so tea... sachets(sp?). My only point being, I know literally nothing about tea (not even Arizonas, sweet or iced tea), so please go easy on me.

Regardless, I am trying to identify a tea to give as a gift to someone this holiday season. Earlier this year my friends and I went to Mitsuwa in New Jersey. For those who don't know Mitsuwa is a large Japanese supermarket with a food court and accompanying stores nearby. While I don't drink tea, I did go down the tea aisle with my friends and one of the things we noticed was a sign that had a simple graphic above the tea shelves explaining how caffeinated the various kinds of teas were. It listed a bunch between 1-5 stars (out of 5)... but then there was an outlier... One specific tea was listed at something like 11 out of 5. We eventually located the spot on the shelf for it, but it was sold out... So I don't even know what this looks like to give more information. I'd like to get this tea for one of my friends as a gift, even if it ends up being terrible tasting the memory of shopping together and this story will make a fine gift I think. If it comes down to it I'll just go there again, but if I can save myself the \~1 hour drive each way, not to mention it being potentially sold out again that would be awesome. 

So does anyone know what this tea is? Can it be bought online somewhere? Mitsuwa didn't have a complete inventory listed online so I don't think their website will be much help, but maybe someone will navigate it better than I did.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I know nothing about tea, but I saw a tea listed as 11/5 caffeine at a Mitsuwa in New Jersey a few months back and now want to get it as a gift for one of the friends I was with when we originally saw it. I don't know what it is, or even what the packaging looks like since it was sold out at the time.",1607441680

tea,molitar,k8xyne,What are good recommendations besides Hibiki-an?,"I liked Hibiki-an with there sampler sets like the Kurigane Sampler set that came with  Gyokuro Karigane Superior, Sencha Karigane, and Houjicha Karigane.  It was a great way to sample tea but now that the shipping cost is half the price of the tea from Hibiki-an it's no longer a good affordable option.
  
What are other good sites that have sampler sets or great pricing with reasonable shipping?  I want the authentic Japanese Loose Tea as I use Chazutsu 200g ones to store my tea in with a tea maker that regulates the water temperature and has a built in timer for the steeping. 

I like samplers as I can try out various teas.. I loved the Houjicha Karigane from Hibiki-an when I tried that sampler. 

If the site also carries snacks even better as I sometimes like to try the various snacks or holiday candies they have on Hibiki-an like last year I purchased the ITO TEMARI and MATCHA AME and wow.. them were good as well as a Furoshiki to wrap them in.",1607403863

tea,throwthrowthrowfuck,k8uox7,Favorite tea bags/loose leaf tea for daily iced tea drinking?,I LOVE LOVE LOVE iced tea and instead of buying the regular unsweetened pure leaf black tea everytime I go to the grocery store I decided to buy a Takeya pitcher to make my own. I'm new to brewing my own tea and looked through some of the suggested vendors in the subreddit but got pretty overwhelmed. I would love to eventually invest in great tea but I don't know what exactly to pick. If I want a basic tasty black tea to brew for iced tea what would y'all recommend?,1607391830

tea,NeatChocolate2,kt1d2a,"Fixing teapots, Hagi ware and where to buy it","Hi all! I'm going to address a few different things in this post. They are all about Hagi ware. 

Firstly, I encountered a tragedy a few days ago: my Hagi yaki teapot that my partner had gifted me less than a month ago was broken by him (in an accident). There was some luck, and the teapot wasn't damaged that much, it was only the knob on the lid that got broke off. I think it's possible to glue it quite smoothly, but here's where I'm asking your advice. Does anyone know which sort of glue should I go for? Obviously something that is good for ceramics, but what I'm contemplating is the temperature that the glue can stand. So far I've found one that says it's good up to 65C. Maybe I am thinking this too much, but do you think it will be enough? The teapot is primarily used for brewing green tea so it's not like I'm pouring 100C water into it, but I guess the lid still gets a fair amount of heat especially in longer sessions. What do you think? 

If anyone has any stories about breaking precious teaware I could do with some peer support - it sucks that the thing that had to break was the newest, prettiest and most precious both in financial and emotional value.  

Naturally, after this accident I went to the internet to see if I could find a replacement. After some searching I found [this](https://www.tablinstore.info/) store that sells teapots similar to what I have. Do anyone of you have experience ordering from there? It looks reliable to me, but I'm still wondering if it's a trustworthy site selling the ""real deal"" so to speak. I don't know if it's pure madness to even think about getting another kyusu when the one I have will still be probably okay to use, but I grew fond of some of the pots on the site... 

Lastly, when reading about Hagi ware on Wikipedia I learned that its substance is porous and this means the colour of the pot will change in time. I had assumed that since it's glazed it's okay to use it for any tea, but does this mean that one pot should be dedicated to one tea type, as is the case with Yixing teapots? Should I also avoid washing it with soap? In the beginning I brewed some oolong with it and the leaves were left in the pot for some time and the smell stuck, so I washed it with detergent but after that I've only brewed green tea with it. Just wondering if I should keep it strictly green tea pot or is it okay to brew something else every once in a while. 

Thank you to anyone who can answer any of the questions! Hopefully you all have good day and some good tea to enjoy.",1610108252

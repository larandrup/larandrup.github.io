I bought 100g of a South Indian White Havukal from TeaGschwendner, and it was absolutely divine. I had drunken mostly black coffee and some english breakfasts I had no clue how to make, and my first real cup of a more delicate tea was just great. Months later, this tea now tastes just more uniform and doesn't evoke the same emotions within me. I've stopped drinking coffee altogether and I've noticed I can taste much more in my other teas, but this one just feels flat now. Even if I prepare it in the exact same way (which isn't how I prefer it anymore) it just isn't the same. Could it be that maybe it's because I'm closer to the bottom of the bag and there are more stems and twigs? Or just that my palate has refined some and this isn't nearly as nuanced as I originally thought? It's still good, and when I eyeball the amount of leaves (usually adding a bit more than recommended) it has a lot more of a richer quality and is much smoother, I just can't get it as good as how it once was.

Tea, or ""infusions"" in general, have been a thing for literally thousands of years.  More plants than I can count (in addition to tea itself) are used as an infusion throughout all kinds of different cultures.

Similarly, tobacco has been used for at least hundreds (maybe thousands?) of years by many different cultures, in many different forms--pipes, cigars, nasal snuff, Swedish snus, American dip, etc.

How have the two never crossed?  We've been infusing all kinds of plants into hot water for thousands of years, and using tobacco in many different formats for almost as long.  Is there something inherent to tobacco which would make it unsuitable as an infusion?  Obviously just steeping some pipe tobacco or snus or whatever in hot water would be disgusting, but then again smoking snus or putting cigarette tobacco in your mouth would be equally gross--point being, tobacco is cultivated and cured for specific purposes.

tea,BigAlOof,k6c7le,Can this kettle be refurbished?,"I've had this kettle &gt; 10 years and -never- descaled it. I know that is not good. I tried using CLR on it and got no real results. I also tried heating it up with baking soda and water but as per some instructions I found. It said to 'let it heat for 30 minutes"" but it bubbled over pretty quickly.  

Does anyone have advice on the best way to get this kettle back into working condition? I'd hate to toss it cause I feel like it's supposed to last forever, but I am also no sure I'm comfortable using it anymore.

Oh, and also nothing i've read addresses the top part of the inside. It feels like it has also got lime/rust/what-have-you on it, but I can't see it. does it need to be scrubbed?

thanks for your advice, tea lovers!

tea,john-bkk,k5tx95,What tea drinkers should know about white tea,"I answered a Quora question about white teas, including a summary of main types and pictures of quite a few.  It goes into basic flavor profiles, processing, oxidation level variation, and aging concerns just a little.  Part of the intro:

**White teas tend to be pleasant and interesting, approachable, not astringent at all, and either quite subtle or else possessing good sweetness and intensity, and floral and fruit flavor. Aged versions can pick up deeper dried fruit or warm spice flavors.**

**White tea is considered to be one of the main categories of teas. Those groupings also include black tea (also called red, based on a Chinese-language convention), green, oolong, dark (hei cha, with pu‚Äôer typically grouped as this type), and yellow (which can also be left off as a main type, for being more rare).**

**Processing steps determines these tea types, not other factors (plant type, region source, oxidation level, etc.)...**

I recently got a new tea pot and I'm having an issue where every time I re-steep my tea in the pot, it comes out bitter, and I'm not sure what's causing it. For years I've never had a tea pot, I've just steeped my tea in one cup and poured it through a strainer into another cup, and I've never had any issues with bitterness unless I accidentally made the water too hot or let it steep too long. I generally use about the same temperature and steeping time for re-steeps as I do for the first steep. When I use the tea pot, the first steep comes out perfect, but any subsequent steeps are bitter. I thought maybe the water wasn't all draining out after the first steep, but it doesn't look like there's any more water left than when I used my previous method. I even tried rinsing the leaves with cold water before steeping again, which seems like it helped a bit, but it was still bitter. Any idea what's going on??",1606935066

I'm mostly used to brewing green tea and light oolong teas so I'm still adjusting to black tea. They taste ok but not as strong as I hoped. Something is wrong when a Longjing has a stronger taste than a Jin Jun Mei. Or it could be the quality of the leaves. The black teas I bought weren't too expensive

Here are my brewing parameters: 

&amp;#x200B;

Loose-leaf to water ratio: 2g per 6oz. I've used this ratio for other teas such as Longing, Jasmine Tea, and Tieguanyin and it seems to work out very well. This is also falls within the recommended amount of leaves for western brewing (2-3g per 6-8oz)

Temperature: 90¬∞C. I don't like the dark tasting notes. I also have a low tolerance for astringency and bitterness in my tea

Steeping Time: 3 mins. I've read that black teas can be steeped for 3-5 mins. I usually don't mess around with steep time in order to avoid bitterness and astringency. I tend to play it safe by steeping it at the minimum recommended time. 

&amp;#x200B;

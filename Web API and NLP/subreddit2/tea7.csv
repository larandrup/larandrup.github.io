tea,elfssoul,lhjs9e,Tea blending at home (Germany),"Hello tea friends,  


Any of you that live in EU (or more specifically Germany) and make their own tea blends at home?  


A bit of context: I'm not so much of a traditional tea drinker as I only allow myself to drink black/green/white tea in the mornings and even though I enjoy them pure, I also like teas with flavors. So naturally, I omit the ""wake up"" tea and drink just herbal, floral, or fruit tea in the afternoons/evenings. My partner also enjoys those worm or as iced tea, so we go through a few teapots a day in this stay at home situation.  


There are a lot of places that I bought and I can buy the actual tea base - quality and safe for drinking, for when I want that caffeine. But my question is about the rest:   


Where are you sourcing your non-tea tea ingredients from - herbs, floral, dried fruit? Anything specific I should be looking for to check if they are suitable for steeping?

One of my fondest memories was going to the sushi restaurants and having the unlimited green tea that they had there.  I'm not sure what it was, but Google has led me to something called ""agari tea"" which sounds kind of like leftover scraps from other green teas. It may be considered low quality or cheap, but I actually really enjoyed it.

&amp;nbsp;


I don't know if anyone knows what I'm talking about, but in the restaurants it came in little covered cups with a metal stick that you'd use to just get a pinch of the powder and then you'd use the hot water on tap to make the tea.

Does anyone know of somewhere I can get something like this? Or do you think matcha would be a close approximation (and also an upgrade)?

I have found that I generally drink two 16 ounce cappuccino mugs of tea in the morning. I do the same at dinner. I thought it would be nice to get an infuser teapot that I could use on the stove-top which would hold a bit more than 32 ounces. 40 seems about right, and the pots are the same price anyway -- just under 18 bucks.

tea,LunaWantsToBake,lfhqns,How long can brewed tea last?,"I was wondering, if I brewed tea and took out the leaves but left it warm for a couple hours to maintain the heat so whoever in my house can still drink it hot. Would that effect how the tea tasted in any way? Sorry if this a silly question. Trying to educate myself.",1612807616

tea,penguinflapsss,lfgdqh,Teapot vs gaiwan - brewing directions,"Hi fellow tea lovers! Ive only been drinking oolongs out of a gaiwan, though all of the recommended directions on the packages suggest a teapot. I usually follow the degree recommendation, but have upwards of five infusions with 30-60 second intervals. If I were to follow the precisely recommended temp, time, weight, and teapot capacity, how much better would the tea be? Could I continue to do multiple infusions after the first? Basically am I cheating myself out of good cups? Thank you in advance. Love this community.",1612804061

tea,wskv,kbz8nm,I think my boss is giving my baristas erroneous information about tea! Help!,"Hi r/tea,

I am the director of education for my small coffee company. I oversee about 8 employees and ensure that they meet all sorts of standards for coffee service and knowledge, like processing methods at the farm level and preparation in the cafe. 

My coffee company recently started sourcing its own teas, which is great because I love tea for all the same reasons that I love coffee. However, I wasn‚Äôt consulted before my boss distributed some educational material to my baristas, and a lot of the information therein seems to run contrary to what I‚Äôve learned about tea over my career working in specialty coffee.

We offer western style tea service. Everything is to-go due to COVID, so we put a tea bag in a 16oz cup and add hot water from our FETCO brewer that is probably between 195F and 205F. With that in mind, here are some of the issues I have with my boss‚Äôs educational material that I am looking for clarification on:

1. ‚ÄúWhite teas need a long steep time because it is the only tea that isn‚Äôt rolled during processing, which leaves the cell structures intact.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always treated white teas similarly to green teas. In past conversations with the owners of tea companies (like Song Tea out of San Francisco), it was generally suggested white teas benefit from lower temperature water and shorter steep times in the range of 2-3 minutes. 

2. ‚ÄúOolong tea leaves require water that is at or just below boiling.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always understood that oolongs greatly benefit from much lower temperature water.

3. ‚ÄúBlack teas made from spring picked buds benefit from a lower water temperature.‚Äù

This is the first time I‚Äôve heard about lower temperatures for black teas at all. I was under the assumption that there wasn‚Äôt really a distinction between brewing black teas that were harvested at different times of the year. 

Am I out of the loop a bit? Are my assumptions and prior experiences with western style tea brewing amiss?

Thank you r/tea for your guidance! Cheers!",1607814825

I'll admit up front that I don't personally drink tea, but many of my closest friends do. In an effort to make them something special, I wanted to try make them some custom tea blends based on a podcast we all love, the Film Reroll! I found out that the company Adagio Teas allows users to make their own custom blends and group them together into fandoms, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The only problem is that I have no idea what different kinds of teas there are or what they taste like. If anybody here has any recommendations for the following ""theme ideas"" I would be very, very grateful to hear them.  


Film Reroll Blend - A mess of things that shouldn't work but actually turns out amazing.  


Peartree University Blend - A fictional college located on a small island off the main coast of Oregon. Despite the name, the school's crest is of a peach tree, so theoretically either fruit could work. It also has light supernatural elements; very Night Vale/Gravity Falls/Twin Peaks vibes, if that can be made into a flavor(?)  


Sweetplum Blend - One of the four houses of the University. Known for its students being artsy, dramatic, romantic, and willing to punch anybody that questions them on anything.   


Meadowbrush Blend - One of the four houses. Known for its students being earthy and outdoorsy.  


Okaroot Blend - One of the four houses. Known for its students being athletic and sporty. Unfortunately I don't have much more than this to go on.  


Willowwing: One of the four house. Known for its students being academic, adventurous, and hiding a dark secret.

I recently rediscovered some tea that I got gifted a couple years back (well actually my sister got it gifted by Taiwanese hotel guests and gave it to me, since she doesn't drink that much tea) which I was amazed with after I finally gave it a try.

This is the 2nd green oolong in my life - again from TTC. It's almost twice as cheap compared to the Longfengxia green oolong and I like it more. It's way more fragrant and I actually love these more floral notes. It has slight tiny bitter feel at the back of my throat but it's not something bad. 

I think that if I didn't know that this is a green oolong, I would've thought that it is a very good green tea. I'm not a fan of green tea, but this is really pleasant. Also it's my first ""baozhong"" whatever this means (Google says ""wrapped tea""), but I would buy this again. The floral notes are intense (my flower memory is not very good but probably lilac+jasmine?) and I enjoyed it for 5 infusions, then becames a little flat but I stopped at the 10th infusion (still fragrant, but watery in taste)

I think that the price is very reasonable ($0.32/g) for the awesome floral fragrance and nice light taste, probably cheaper because of the lower altitude, but it's still a Wild West to determine why one tea is expensive and other cheap. But this was a good surprise in terms of price and quality. I will try brewing it in 85-90C water next time but even if I can't remove the slight bitterness, it's still very good, one of my faves : 9/10! Definitely recommend it (lot 929)!

You can also talk about anything else on your mind, from your specific routine while making tea, or how you've been on an oolong kick lately. Feel free to link to pictures in here, as well.  You can even talk about non-tea related topics; maybe you want advice on a guy/gal, or just to talk about life in general.",1607601640
tea,istara,kadxkf,Really enjoying the T2 calendar this year (spoilers inside),"There have been some great ones. My absolute favourite so far has been the [Gingernut Chai](https://www.t2tea.com/en/au/tea/gingernut-chai-loose-leaf-gift-cube-T125AE255.html) which I think I'll actually buy.

I also enjoyed the Sticky Date (rooibos one) and the Creme Brulee. 

Morning Sunshine was also nice, it's quite a strong one. I chanced upon a discounted box of it at TKmaxx a day later so bought that.",1607600742

tea,Boccololapideo,kad467,Help me identify a tea I received as a gift please,"Dear tea lovers, I received a tea as a gift from a dear friend but I don't know what type of tea it may be.

[Leaves](https://imgur.com/rV3Y8Ny) and [container](https://imgur.com/VmuJqpw)

The tea comes from China, my friend got it from a client from Shenzhen, but she threw away the box. It's good, I made it with 80¬∞ water and I left it brewing for 3 minutes. It as a light amber colour and the taste it's almost sweet, like caramel. Even leaving it brewing for longer times it doesn't get bitter. 

The leaves leave a faint yellowy trace on white paper.

 I've excluded it being green tea, but it doesn't resemble any black tea I've ever had. What can it be?

Many thanks for any help you can give. Sorry for language mistakes.",1607596426

If you love tea in any other extent or fashion, e.g. as an occasional or maybe even everyday companion, but striving consistently for the most researched, authentic tasting experience is not your main concern, then please click away, this post is not meant for you: there are many other ways to obtain decent water for your brews, that are much more environmentally and practically sustainable, than buying expensive and hard-to-come-by, fine-tea-enhancing bottled water.*

\*\*\* RE-POSTING \*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

What water do you use with your special eastern teas? Do you avoid bottled water on principle?

If you do, the reason might be related with caring about the environment: I can relate with that. But when it comes to water and fine eastern tea, bad water kills the brew and my pleasure in drinking it, so I wonder: what is the point of looking for high quality, delicate leaves? That is a topic that puzzles me greatly, for the extent that its importance is underrated and casually disregarded among eastern tea enthusiasts and vendors alike.

Brewed tea is more than 99% water, and water interacts and bonds in a complex way with the tea compounds at a chemical level. It stands to logic that an essential part of the flavour of the final brew will depend on the quality of the water you used. For example, did you ever read anything about something called '***tea creaming***'? In short, it is a phenomenon that occurs when minerals in water aggregate the aromatic particles of tea into bigger molecules, that are not any more perceivable by our senses: in other words, water that is more mineral than let's say \~60 mg/l (a personal estimate based on years of experiments), not only it has a strong taste that may conceal, alter or cloud part of the goodness of tea, but it --literally-- **deprives the tea of its aromatic compounds** **(by precipitation)**, lowering *significantly* the number of ‚Äútasty‚Äù molecules that we can perceive. Does it make sense to you, buying carefully-made, highly expensive tea, to only perceive (and enjoy) half of its taste because of the wrong water?

But good water is so much more than the TDS value. It is a delicate balance between the individual quantities of the most important ions that influence flavour. In particular, calcium \[CA++\] (sweet, umami, earthy), magnesium \[MG++\] (bitter-sweet), sodium \[Na+\] (salty, bitter), potassium \[K+\] (sweet / salty, bitter), bicarbonates \[HCO3--\] (salty, alkaline, limy), sulphates \[SO4--\] (salty, rancid), chloride \[CL-\] (salty), silica \[SiO2\] (sweet).

Traditional water filters are not a good alternative medium to achieve tea-suitable water. They use two main mechanisms: ionic exchange and activated charcoal. Ionic exchange usually gives back two molecules of sodium for every calcium molecule it takes: that‚Äôs it. Involved ions may differ, but the idea is always the same: it is an *exchange*. Activated charcoal mostly filters organic compounds, not minerals. Both methods do very little to alter the balance of most of the other ions.

Inverted osmosis and other more advanced means of filtering, like ZeroWater filters, are certainly a better option, if you want to avoid bottles at all cost. But these methods of purification cannot differentiate between useful and non-useful ions: they filter acritically. Most importantly, they filter too much, for the purpose of tea brewing: resulting water has a TDS that is close to zero (it is almost a distilled water). Beside, both are quite expensive. Ultimately, if the source water is not good, it may end up being significantly less bad, but that does not mean that it will became a water that is suitable for tea. Acritically filtered water has no character and it lacks the balanced edges that good tea requires.

That is the scientific side.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif c2u0yv2hkw861...*

From a humanistic perspective, in a way, tea is a celebration of water. Just think about the aesthetic and the cultural context behind the practices of Â∑•Â§´Ëå∂ and Ëå∂„ÅÆÊπØ. It may sound silly, but through tea I fell in love with water and its sounds. I rediscovered that which I used to pay too little attention about: the beauty implicit into something so ordinary. Remarkably, I was reminded of the importance of water and of fighting for the environment that keeps it clean, in every other way that is available to me. I use magnesium BWT filters for drinking and cooking, and I try to do my part everyday, buying locally sourced, zero waste and organic as much as I can; recycling properly (glass and plastic bottles are easy to re-use and to recycle efficiently), using public transportation, not owning a car, paying for energy produced from renewable sources. If I take that into account, I believe I can still make a difference. Sometime, the ethical perspective needs to consider the aesthetic and strive to find a balance with it, otherwise life becomes merely functional, mechanical. Of all the possible reasons for using bottled water, preparing authentic eastern tea is the reasonable one for me. I believe something is lost in undermining the importance of prioritizing beauty, for a few things that you really love and that make you a better person: beauty is the reason the world deserves to be saved, and too often we forget to keep that goal **connected with the means we use to achieve it**. Tea culture and tea drinking help with that connection, if we let them. That is why it is called mindfulness.

My advice is not: use bottled water for your top quality teas. My advice is a little more complex than that, and it is rooted in the idea of self-made experience. Learning about water influenced my love of tea and changed my experience with it. So I am writing: please experiment with it, **before** choosing. Question your decision of avoiding bottled water for tea with an open mind to make a personal but **-informed-** decision. Find and buy a couple of bottles of a water that is great for tea: **TDS between 20 and 60 mg/l, slightly acidic PH, hardness &lt;3¬∞F, possibly poor in bicarbonates and rich in magnesium, calcium and silica**. Now try brewing a wide range of authentic, excellent eastern teas that you love in two teapots, maintaining the exact same parameters, but using the bottled water in the first, and the tap water you normally use, in the second. Wait, then possibly try again with a different kind of tea, until you sampled at least all the main categories. After that, if you find that the difference is something you can do without, or if you think the impact of your using plastic bottles is going to nullify every other effort you can make for the environment, or if you think that your tap water brew still honours the effort that tea makers put into crafting your special teas, then please stay with it! I shall happily rest my case, but at least you will base your decision on your own research and experience.

tea,CodeNameLiamm,koear5,I want to start blending custom loose teas,"Hi!

I am interested in blending custom teas. There are good instructions on the internet for basic recipes and how to get into it, but where should I purchase the basic tea from? I would rather purchase in bulk, but I'm fine if not. What I am saying, is where can I purchase the basic stuff to start making teas? I don't want pre-blends as you would normally purchase.

Thank you very much!",1609519399

You can also talk about anything else on your mind, from your specific routine while making tea, or how you've been on an oolong kick lately. Feel free to link to pictures in here, as well.  You can even talk about non-tea related topics; maybe you want advice on a guy/gal, or just to talk about life in general.",1609502414
tea,bananananana6,ko6bvk,Has anyone here tried making tea cakes out of green tea?,"I remember that sheng pu-erh or raw pu erh wasnt classified as pu-erh for a long time, it used to be classified as sun dried green tea. So technically we can make a green tea cake and age it. I saw [this](https://youtu.be/CrVVglIWtC8) on youtube and i think i can simulate the process with a small amount of tea.

Looking for some thick smooth aged white teas... usually order off YS/White2Tea so if you guys have any specific recommendations that you've tried and loved that would be amazing!

tea,DubWyse,ko4t9k,Recommend me a loose leaf tea sampler,"Interested in trying some loose leaf teas, but no idea where to start on what I like. In bagged tea, I like Stash peach black tea, as well as their pear green tea. 

Ok with herbal, green, black, oolong, and white (though I can‚Äôt name any of the last two I‚Äôve tried and liked). I like sweet (mostly because I‚Äôm cutting out soda and juice and have a hard time tasting the tea right now), but I‚Äôd be interested in trying some nice tasting non-fruit flavored teas as well. 

Thanks!",1609474604

I'll typically do about 4/5 steeps at a time to myself sometimes even 6. My question now is am I over consuming? As I see most people who do gong fu brewing use these teeny tiny cups which I simply cannot be bothered for, I feel like maybe this style of brewing just isn't the most practical when I just want something hot to sip whilst I'm working during the day. Does anyone else do solo gong fu style brewing the way I do or am I alone here?

I believe I'm good at creating any of the herbal and true teas by steeping the right time and temp and serving hot, but I don't get the same satisfaction when I try to serve cold. I also enjoy drinking it at room temp when cooling down in the steep as naturally (without removing the leaves, so I would expect it to be too bitter), but still serving cold doesn't do it for me. 
I'm curious if anyone has any routines he/she follows. Right now, I just steep the normal way, take out the tea so it doesn't steep further, and store in the fridge. I feel the tea usually comes out a bit more bitter and harsh than I might expect.",1609867097

I tried a sample I got that's from a compressed cake twice now and feel it didn't turn out well either time. First attempt I had 2 primary chunks around 5grams, so 2x 2.5g. This was better than the 2nd attempt when I used 1x 5g chunk. Should I be aiming to use a single large chunk or multiple smaller pieces? 

I watched some videos and some people suggested letting the tea sit for 5-7 minutes after rinsing to let it open up because that seems to be my biggest issue. Even letting it sit after a rinse didn't really open it up. I'll brew 3-4 times with it still compressed and I feel it turns out very watered down and unenjoyable compared to a loose leaf brew that feels perfect from the first brew on. 

I just bought like 4 cakes, so this is quite disappointing since cakes seem to be all the rage. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but these just turn out so much less enjoyable than loose leaf tea that it's almost a complete turn off.",1609849844

The most ""Green Tea"" that i can buy in stores ( even expensive ones ) from normal stores, tea stores or chinese/asian stores is mostly bitter and doesnt taste anywhere near that stuff that i got gifted.

My research till now shows that this is some kind of Oolong Tea (not green tea?!?) from China. But the Brand ""Zhong Min Hong Tai"" is not sold in germany or europe. And it is grown in the An-xi region of China’s Fujian province.

Now there are several stores that sell ""Tie Guan Yin"" from this area ranging from 12-16€ per 100gr. and i have no idea if these are comparable to the one from ""Zhong Min Hong Tai"" or if they are bad too :D should i just order from one of these stores and try it?

tea,Souprx,kqwdp3,Few stupid questions about brewing,"I see people talking about doing a session, what is this and how would you brew for it - I imagine it involves a teapot and a mesh ball?

I have bought a (probably gimmicky, but I like it) glass jug with mesh strainer from Brew Tea Co. It says its a teapot for 1 but it brews 400ml of tea with the leaves directly in the water so it needs pouring out to prevent over extraction. 

I struggle to believe that 400ml is a tea for one as most tea cups appear to come in sizes ranging from 200ml to 350ml. As such I am currently brewing my 'tea for one' and decanting it into what is essentially a sports direct mug - not quite the 'fine tea' experience I was hoping for.

In light of this, should I have bought a classic tea pot like a brown betty and a mesh ball on a stick with some actual fine tea cups?

Finally I bought some 'breakfast tea' with my fancy, gimmicky strainer jug and it seems like it was a pointless exercise as its no better than a twinings assam teabag. However, the earl grey is fantastic so I guess loose leaf tea is for finer / flavoured teas. 

The cauldron ceramics site has something about the design of the teapot allowing the leaves to swirl around inside it but with a 1L teapot this seems like a one way ticket to over extracted tea?

I have a reasonable order from Whittards coming with Oolongs etc that I'm excited to try. But i'm just not completely sold on my brewing vessel currently.

I don't know if it's visible from the photo, but it is VERY thin, it just passes through any strainer I use, and if I let it stay in my mug I will choke on it. I'm also reading on the wiki that dusty tea is bad quality. Do you have any advice on how to make it enjoyable? Or is it even not worth it to try?

I’ve been drinking loose tea for about two years now and I finally not the bullet and decided to try something a little more experienced.

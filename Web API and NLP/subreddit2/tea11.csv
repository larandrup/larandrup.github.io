tea,ablecha,l6w551,Does new white tea have green taste ? Will the white tea with green flavor be transformed into high-quality old white tea after long-term storage?,"It is normal for new white tea to have a little green taste within one or two months after it is put on the market. However, when new white tea still has fishy green taste after half a year, it belongs to improper processing.

If you're hoping to turn green white tea into well-tasting old white tea over a long period of time, you'll be disappointed. 

Green flavor in the flavor of the performance of the plant herbal aroma and taste green astringent. 

From the technical analysis: 
1.grass aroma is a low boiling point of aromatic substances, withering time is not enough, the low boiling point of aromatic substances will be retained. 
2.Taste green and astringent, but also because of the withering time is not enough.

Simply put, insufficient withering time, insufficient binding and conversion of amino acids, polyphenols, and various other substances, will not result in an optimal combination of inclusions. 

So will the changes that occur during withering continue to occur after long periods of storage? The answer is no.

1.White tea has been dried when it is stored, which is different from the condition in which water is retained when the tea is withering. 

2.When white tea is stored, the external environment is also different from that of withering when it is in the sun. 

With such a different internal and external environment, how can storage accomplish the transformation that should take place during withering?",1611839297

Twinings makes some of my favorite teas including today's Darjeeling and Darjeeling Origins blends. I inherited my taste for Twinings from my mother who's love for the brand is only surpassed by her love for the now no-longer-produced Twinings Green and Black tea. Anyways, I thought it would be an interesting change of pace to compare these two blends directly against one another. Both will be brewed with the same water at the same temp for the same length of time and I'll try them side by side.

&amp;#x200B;

Daily Tea #8

Darjeeling Tea, Twinings of London, Black Tea:

Temp: 100c / 212 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 5 min

This tea is one of my staples which I've had hundreds if not thousands of times over the years, so I thought it would make a good choice to help calibrate my reviews and to set a bench mark for what types of teas I like and what score out of ten I would rate something I drink on the regular. While the Darjeeling blend isn't my favorite Twining's blend (we'll see some others later) it has a solid and consistent profile that I can count on 9/10 to deliver an excellent cup of tea.           

If brewed for the correct amount of time -which is critical for most Darjeeling's as the quickly turn bitter- this blend finds a nice balance between the dry, grainy character and the smooth and sweet notes common to Darjeeling tea. This combination of textures and tastes creates a more multi-dimensional profile which holds itself up better to improper brewing while also allowing for the selection of a specific flavour profile depending on the brewing time.     

Both simple enough to drink for a nice pick me up, and complex enough for a sit down to properly enjoy the flavours, this tea really can offer a lot to both the casual drinker and to the more advance palette. While Darjeeling isn't my particular favorite, it's a solid choice for any situation and a blend I recommend to anyone. We shall see if I still hold this blend is such high esteem after 91 more days of tea review but for now this rates a solid score.     

Rating, hot: 7/10           with sugar: 8/10     

Rating, cold: 5/10          with sugar: 5/10

&amp;#x200B;

Daily Tea #9

Origins Darjeeling Tea, Twinings of London, Black Tea:

Temp: 100c / 212 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 5 min

When I sat down to brew both of these teas I expected to have very little to say about the differences between the two of them, after all both of these blends are Darjeeling mixes made by the same company from (presumably) the same tea producers. However, when comparing the Origins Darjeeling to it's standard sibling I found it highlighting my least favorite qualities about Twining's Darjeeling tea. The Very same thing that limits the Darjeeling blend to the lesser ranks of the Twining's catalogue work against this blend. Despite the identical brewing conditions I found the Origins tea to be more brash and rough, bitter and dry. Rather then being refreshed after drinking the pot I just found myself thirst and unsatisfied. Somehow this tea had both an (admittedly very) faint metallic taste (almost like licking a door handle) and a strong woody, almost twiggy, aftertaste which reminds me of the time that I ate a bunch of ash leaves when I was little.     

While I am over magnifying the poor qualities of this tea to make the comparison more clear between this brew and the standard Twinings Darjeeling, I did not particularly enjoy this lesser-middling tea. If you're going to try some yourself I recommend that either you go for a quicker brew at a lower temperature to lessen the astringency or add a good measure of sugar which I found to not only lessen the bitterness, but also to elevate the aforementioned twiggyness into an interesting, if a bit unusual flavour. I'll have to take another go at this blend sometime to see if I just brewed it wrong or had a bad batch but considering that this cost me about 50% more per bag then the standard Twinings Darjeeling, I'm not anxious to buy another box.

Ever since I've gotten into tea, I've been using western style steeping methods. In my search of different methods I came across people using a French press for tea other than coffee. At first I thought someone used it as a last resort, but I've seen guides on how to use it specifically for tea! I'm thinking something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G3L1KF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_XmCeGb325PS0Z?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1


I was originally looking into getting one of those over the cup steepers, here's the link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FPN8TK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_0kCeGbTAJF2PP
I just don't like using any type of plastic as it stains and is harder to clean. So, I always prefer glass or ceramic for cleaning and it's why the French press appeals to me. 


What's your opinion on using a French press solely for brewing tea? Any pros and cons you can see? Only con I see is over steeping, but I always portion out only what I'm able to drink in one sitting.

In 2014 I had the opportunity to go to Beijing. Back then I did not know much about teas, my communication skills were nonexistent, and it was my first time outside Europe. I've asked my guide to help me buy some good tea while we were on the Wangfujing street. 

In the shop I saw some nice round pu'er cakes, so I decided to buy 3 (first mistake).

I really liked the tea. It had deep woody, earthy flavor accompanied by raisin, orange, brandy notes. Slightly sour, but became sweeter with every steeping.

Now we are in 2021, I have no cake left (yes, I loved them so much that I only brewed from the cakes a few times and far in between). 

My understanding of the language is still as bad as in 2014, although now I have the resolve to learn. The google/Bing searches did not give any usable results, and the teas that I've tasted so far did not come close to the taste of those cakes.

So here I ask you, people of Reddit, to please help a fellow teahead if you can by finding the tea (I've added an image), or recommend one which you would think is up to the task.

Anyone know of a good brand/site for quality spearmint tea? Plain spearmint is one of my favorite ""teas"" but the pack of loose leaf I just bought tastes kinda gnarly. It was from a smaller vendor but I imagine that it was just a bit stale. Spearmint probably isn't their biggest seller so it might have been sitting about for a bit.",1611625079

1. Insulated mug. I want to be able to sip my tea an hour after it's brewed and have it still be hot.

2. Infuser has a saucer of its own so that I can put it on my desk and not have tea leaking all over. **The saucer should be separate from the mug's lid.** I want to still have a usable lid for my insulated mug while my basket rests on its saucer because otherwise what's the point of having an insulated mug? 

3. All of it fits together into one convenient object for easy transport.

So far, everything I've found makes the mug's lid double as the saucer. I really, really don't want that. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks in advance",1611619992

tea,DarkKindness,l4z9nt,Tea Recommendations,"So, I recently got into gongfu brewing and have broadened my tea horizons substantially; after doing a couple of small ceremonial gongfu sessions with my wife, I'm looking for some recommendations of teas that might go over well for us. 

A bit of informative history - I am deeply into matcha and love the flavor profiles of most matchas that I've tried, and my wife enjoys some of the single-origin senchas from Sazen. I also quite like some of the more umami flavors from sencha that are present in matcha as well. We both like espresso - I've become a bit of a home barista over the past year - and we both tend to like a medium to dark roast for espresso; I like cocoa and fruity flavors in mine, and she tends to appreciate sweet and fruity notes. We both like chai (lightly sweetened, with or without milk) for non-Japanese tea. Of the Chinese teas that we've tried thus far, she has not cared for the floral notes in a Jasmine green or the Honey Orchid style of Dan Cong.

With all of that said, what are some recommendations from you fine folks for teas that might be worth trying? I'm primarily interested in sticking to oolongs, sencha, and Chinese greens, but would entertain pretty much any suggestion for loose leaf; however, I'm not interested in making the dive into pu erh quite yet.

Oh, and worth noting - as it stands, I tend to order on a pretty regular basis from Sazen, Yunnan Sourcing, and Hibiki-an, so something from one of them would be a bonus for ease of accessibility.

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to looking into your teas!",1611613492

tea,gilrain,l4tuvg,Help with first grandpa attempt.,"I've always been a little intimidated to try grandpa style brewing, but decided to give it a go today. I added 5 g of Longjing to my 1 liter Nalgene water bottle and topped it up with 175 degree water.

That was a half hour ago, and most of the tea is still floating on top preventing me from drinking. I'd estimate about 1/10th of the leaves have sunk. I even gave it a light shake and some thumps.

Is it supposed to take this long? MarshalN specifically calls out Longjing as a good candidate for grandpa style, so I wasn't expecting trouble.

In the mornings I drink black tea, sometimes a couple hours after eating breakfast no problems, but if I switch to green or oolong or white tea, it often upsets my stomach unless I've eaten a decent snack or after lunch.  I never have this issue in the afternoon before dinner either.  It's really weird as it seems to only affect me at lunch and non black teas.  Sometimes honey and sometimes not, so it's not a sweetness thing IMO.  

Anyone else?",1611587814

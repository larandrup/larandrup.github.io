It came today and I'm trying the Irish Breakfast Tea (loose leaf)... I don't know if I'm making it wrong or if I just don't really care for it. Up til now I've mostly only had Bigelow Green Teas and Chamomile Tea. 

The Irish Breakfast Tea can says 1 tsp per 8oz. My mug is around 15oz so I did 2 tsp. I'm used to strong black coffee so I tried it first with nothing added and wasn't sure if I liked it. It says it goes well with milk and sugar. I can't have dairy so I used some coconut milk creamer. Still wasn't too good so I added coconut sugar (cuz I try to limit sugar) and that was a mistake. So then I googled Irish Breakfast Tea. Read about traditionally the milk was put in the cup first (about 1/3 of the cup) and that it's better that way. Made another cup with the coconut milk creamer in the cup first. No sugar this time. And I still don't care for it.

Any suggestions, or should I just say I don't like this tea? I'm willing to keep trying it in different ways, just not sure what else to try.",1614887342

The experience was awesome! The tea is... very good but I've had way better oolongs. But I'm buying this again for sure! The good thing is that the tea is very flavourful - it's not a fragrant water like the Taiwanese oolongs I praise so much. The dry leaves had an amazing fragrance. The wet leaves were even more fragrant (duh), but... I brewed this for 30s - 30s - 40s and I can't smell almost anything in the liqueur. Ok a little exaggerated, I can, but it's a little underwhelming after smeling the leaves. It's very floral and it reminds me of Ya Shi Dancong but without the dry mouthfeel. I'm oversteeping it a little - did 90 seconds for the 6th steep and I love it. I'm a fan of very watery and weak oolongs, so I can say that this oolong is very smooth even oversteeped! There is some good punch that I can't call bitter or astringent (probably some super low level of bitterness/astringency/acidity combined into an amazing mouthfeel). I recommend this for sure!

I live in the US and some years ago  received a T2 loose leaf tea sampler from Australian relatives and loved the teas.

Fast forward to now - we have a T2 tea shop in our area and I purchased a 50 pk bag of Melbourne Breakfast in tea bags. It was 50 percent off due to what I thought was an expiry date issue, but when I use these tea bags, they always rip open when the tag is being separated from the paper teabag, no matter how careful I am. I look at the tea bags and they are actually so thin, I think there are holes elsewhere in the bag, notwithstanding.

This is okay for personal use, as I put it in a strainer (and I add some extra Madagascar Vanilla loose leaf T2 as well!), but wondering if anyone know if the poor quality tea bag is a consistent issue with this brand? If it is, I wouldn't want to give boxed tea in bags as a gift, for example, or even pay full price for it for my own use.",1614868824

tea,ProbablyNotPoisonous,lxgitk,Yet another oolong question from a beginner,"I have a small assortment of oolong teas from Song Tea and Dachi Tea. I have been brewing gongfu style and have been underwhelmed, so I decided recently to go through them again brewing according to the package directions (shocking, I know), which mostly means lower leaf-to-water ratios and longer steep times than with gongfu. I'm not drinking them in any particular order, just deciding based on my mood.

For water, I'm using bottled ""National Artesian Water"" brand bottled water. Claims to have a 7.8 pH, for whatever that's worth. Tastes a hell of a lot better than filtered tap water, anyway.

Brewing vessel is a small double-walled glass mug with a lid.

The first tea I tried this with was [Dachi Verdant Valley](https://dachitea.co/product/verdant-valley/), which is a Taiwanese high mountain oolong. Package instructions: 5g tea, 150 ml water, 194 F (rounded to 190 on my kettle), 1-2 minutes. I was blown away by the result!

* Smells *exactly* like blooming lilacs, especially on the first couple of steeps

* Mild bitterness and intense sugary-sweet aftertaste on the first steep

* Subsequent steeps: bitterness disappears; tea now has a fresh, green taste with, indeed, cantaloupe-like aromatics. Finish is less intense, but still quite sweet and pleasant.

* Not the creamiest texture; but still noticably more so than plain water.

* Petered out after 5 or 6 infusions; I wasn't actually counting.

Tonight I tried [2018 Meizhan Yancha](https://songtea.com/products/meizhan-yancha) from Song Tea. Package instructions: 5g tea, 150 ml water, 205 F, 1 min 30 seconds. My kettle has settings for 200 and ""boil,"" but nothing between. I started at 200, but then increased to ""boil, but pour into another cup for a few moments,"" and then just straight boiling water, because - I got very little flavor from this tea other than faint minerals. Increasing the temperature yielded a very faint fruity aroma, but nothing I would call ""dark"" or ""intense."" Also not much ""thickness"" to the mouthfeel, which seems weird because Song Tea specifically calls that out in their description.

So what gives?

Theories:

* Maybe the yancha is just old? I've read it doesn't keep well (but then, I've also read it does). I store my tea in its original, opaque, airtight packaging; but it gets hot here in summer, so heat might be an issue.

* Maybe the water isn't hot enough, despite what my kettle claims?

* Maybe the tea is relatively lower-quality to begin with, and Song Tea is overselling it in the description? Certainly it's not very expensive for a yancha.

* Maybe I'm just inexperienced and expecting too much/comparing it unfairly to the (imho) very sweet and beginner-friendly Dachi high mountain oolong? I don't know *much,* but I know oolong is a massive category and high mountain oolongs are very different from rock oolongs.

tea,josqvin,lx087f,Chinese Black Tea Question: Souchong vs Congou,"Souchong (xiao zhong, meaning ""small type"") refers specifically to a small leaf varietal tea plant found in the Wuyi area and its surroundings. The first black teas were made from this plant in that area and are often found with the moniker ""lapsang"" (zhen shan, meaning ""true mountain"") to specify the Wuyi origin. (Note that a genuine lapsang souchong will not always be smoked.) The most famous souchong tea now is probably Jin Jun Mei. 

Congou (gong fu, meaning ""with skill"") refers to black teas also made in the same area, e.g. Bai lin gongfu or tan yang gong fu, which are both Fujian origin teas (collectively known as ""minhong gongfu""). However teas from other provinces frequently have the ""gongfu"" or congou name attached, i.e. Keemun gongfu (from Anhui) and Ninghong gongfu (from Jianxi, which borders on Wuyi). These two other can be explained as an extension of the Fujian gongfu black tea tradition, I would think. However, I have also seen teas from yunnan adopt the moniker--Dianhong gongfu. 

It would seem that congou or gongfu style black tea making represents some kind of refinement or advancement of the original souchong black tea production style. This would also explain the name. However, I would be grateful if someone could provide additional information as to the origins and relationship between these two types of black tea.

Starting April 1st, the US will be the first country to have its own international postal group and the rates are going to increase significantly. For many sites, this means higher shipping fees, and for others, the price of their tea will be increased across the board.

This change came after the US decided to withdrawal itself from the Universal Postal Union for unfair advantages for countries like China that could send a package from across the world for cheaper than the national interstate postage rate.

The UPU and the USA came to an agreement for the US to remain under the condition that it could charge a flat rate to all countries wishing to ship into the US market.

Other countries have also expressed interest in incorporating this into their own countries. So you should keep an eye on the news from your own countries as well. 

Lastly, I think this will affect Chinese teas the most as they are going to see the biggest changes in cost. Companies there will have to decide if they want to raise their prices by a lot, or offer shipping at much higher rates than before. Unless the government subsidizes the changes. 

The increase for Japanese teas should only be about $4-5 per package. So if you are a Mr. Moneybags it might not be a big deal. But if your just buying a little 50g sample, your now gonna need an extra $11.50 for shipping instead of $8.",1614734477

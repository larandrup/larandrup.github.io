tea,KBrehm3,knht0b,Science Fair,"I'm doing a science fair project on how the concentration of tea affects tea's antibacterial properties. I am comparing two brands of green tea bags and two brands of green loose leaf tea. My units for concentration are mg of tea leaves / mL of water. I was planning on doing concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg/mL.

If I use tea bags, I am going to have to change the amount of water I'm using instead of the amount of tea leaves because there is a set amount of leaves in each bag. To do a concentration of 30 mg/mL, I need to brew tea with about 2 ounces of water. While I might be able to get it to be submerged, I'm afraid that there won't be enough water or space for the leaves to expand and the nutrients and polyphenols to be fully released. 

If I were to attempt to change this, adding two tea bags to change the amount of water won't solve the problem. The ratio still has to be the same and the ratio of tea leaves to water is what is causing the issue. 

How can I find a way to look at concentrations while still having plenty of water for the leaves to expand? Any advice or help would be appreciated.",1609385124

tea,dohrey,kn14ku,What actually happens when you age oolong or black tea?,"The aging of puer tea is talked about a lot and there seems to be a lot of consensus that the ""aging"" process is as a result of a combination of oxidation and microbial activity.


There also seems to be a decent amount of consensus (even if the aging process is not as developed) that for white tea the aging process is essentially a a result of oxidation.


But I am quite interested in what happens when oolongs and black teas are aged. 


Aging of oolongs seems to be relatively established but I can't find any explanation of what the ""aging"" actually involves - presumably it is not microbial activity given the general recommendation is that oolongs should be kept dry and cool whilst aging. Similarly, surely it can't be oxidation as the ""kill the green"" process in oolongs should stop this (unlike white tea or raw puer). Does anyone therefore know what the aging mechanism is or is it a mystery?


There also seem to be increasing numbers of vendors selling compressed black tea - mainly sun-dried Yunnan black tea. I have seen previous discussions here that aging there could be a result of further oxidation as with white tea, but could it also be the same as whatever process causes oolong aging? There seems to be some suggestion that aging could improve even non sun dried black tea - e.g. this aged black tea on teadb doesn't seem to be from Yunnan although I am not sure about its processing: https://teadb.org/2009-haoxin-hongcha-red-black-tea-episode-331/",1609329991

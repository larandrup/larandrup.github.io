I added some white sugar and caramel sauce for flavor but that's basically all this tea tasted like. This brand makes chai that's very flavorful. I know it's possible I got older tea but why didn't it taste like anything?",1608828192

I had no idea it would receive the response it did, and honestly it was just really cool for me to see something I created  be of such interest to people. My ‚Äúshop‚Äù is just my wife and me at home,  and last week we found ourselves making and shipping way more ounces of  tea than we ever imagined needing to make at such an early stage in  this venture (we‚Äôre just 3 weeks in!).

We had enough ingredients in the house to make a pound of tea, which normally would last a week, but last week that was not the case. The pound of tea went out to everyone in order, which covered most of you, but there were a few more orders to fill. I have a couple ingredients I cant get locally, and the short version is I hadn't been able to get one of them until today (I first reordered it last week using USPS 2 day, and that didn't make a difference. Then reordered it via Fedex Overnight on Monday, and it arrived this morning). So all remaining orders went  out today. I tried everything I could to get it here sooner but got overwhelmed with orders when I shared it here and it unfortunately  coincided with these unprecedented USPS delays, when at normal time it  would've been here in 2 days...

Being new to this, I've been really preoccupied with this over the last week, and given a couple people checked in with me today, I figured I would just share this situation with you all in case anyone else was  wondering.

Thank you so much to  those who have been understanding about the wait. It's the last thing I  wanted to happen, and I truly had no idea that post would generate more than a handful of inquiries.

So that said, I wanted to sincerely thank this sub for all the interest, upvotes, and thought provoking questions you all asked. As one who does this for the passion more than the money, I really enjoyed sharing with a  community of people who have genuine interest in tea and dreaming and the ways we can use plant aids to enhance our dreams.

Today I received the tin of Ummon that I ordered from Ippodo for a comparison, and I am blown away by the taste, the quality, and the difference in physiological response/energy that I get out of it.

With that said, I'm looking for a daily drinking matcha. I drink usucha with nothing added to it, usually two to three times per day. I've read other threads with recommendations, and I have some Aoarashi and Isuzu coming from Marukyu Koyamaen (courtesy of Sazen) to try, but I wanted to check here to see if there are any recommendations for a good daily drinker to keep on hand considering that I'm likely to go through about 60g every two weeks or so.

My current list of possibilities is as follows:

Aoarashi, Isuzu, Wako (Marukyu)

Kan no Shiro, Sayaka no Mukashi (Ippodo)

The Sayaka would be a bit of a budgetary stretch - I'm looking for that price point or lower - but I REALLY like the way that the Ummon is feeling in terms of energy and the taste was great, so that leads me to strongly consider Ippodo.

tea,martyyeet,khpmmw,Teavivre assortment samples,"Hi, in the last months i'm getting more into tea and i wanted to get more serious about it.

I'm a beginner and i saw [this sampler test](https://www.teavivre.com/award-winning-tea-sampler-packs.html), is it good? I still need to find what kind of tea i like and wanted to try different things.",1608582966
tea,FlowerGirl4343,khp7li,"This is Ruby Rooibos by Cup of T√©! I chose this because I love the smoothness in taste, and it‚Äôs also so hydrating! In my opinion, it‚Äôs a great alternative for black since it‚Äôs free of caffeine. The steep time for this is 5-6 minutes. I sweetened this with half tbsp of honey.",,1608581686
tea,MacaroniBee,khnbth,What's your favorite pearl jasmine tea?,"Hey all! I'm scoping out a good pearl jasmine tea, and am weighing my options. I'm looking for 100 grams, and am so far trying to decide between Harney and sons, Yunnan sourcing (never tried them before), New Mexico Tea co. and Teavivre... They all come out to be about the same price, and they all look good! If you've tried any of these, what were your thoughts?",1608576228
tea,FlamingHorseRider,khlq5f,Bubble Tea Store Revelation,"So I‚Äôve always thought bubble tea stores, at least the ones in my college town (a few local joints and ones like Kung Fu Tea) had a weird earl grey/‚Äúsignature‚Äù milk tea as earl greys commonly seem to be. Something about them just tastes off compared to the ones I like (Ahmad, Alreef, Harney, even Biggelow and Tazo if I have nothing else) with a faker, more perfumed taste that has made me wonder if it‚Äôs even earl grey- the first time I had some of them I had to find bergamot on the ingredients list to realize. Not to say I don‚Äôt like one once in a while, I‚Äôve just always thought they were off. 

I‚Äôve also had a vendetta against Twinnings earl grey for a long time for the exact same reason, but after returning from college it was the only earl grey here and I wanted some. 

It took me til today to realize a lot of places probably use Twinnings earl grey. Same weirdness in the bergamot flavor, it comes ‚Äúlooseleaf‚Äù and fairly cheap, and it‚Äôs easy to find as a source. I‚Äôm sure in bulk it‚Äôs even cheaper to get. 

That is my ‚Äúthe more you know‚Äù realization of my morning, use this information (educated guess) as you will.",1608571381

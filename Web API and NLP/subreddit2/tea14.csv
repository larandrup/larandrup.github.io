The tea does smell stronger than cooled, I'm not sure if that is normal but it's a bit frustrating.

tea,YSS2020,l1hu50,Looking for a step up from Republic of Tea and Harneys,"So far only got my RoT in the mail. No complaints, it's (loose leaf) definitely better than the store bought stuff around here. I'm expecting my Harney shipment to be here Friday.

I don't mind going a little cheaper for flavored teas as I figure a bit of the teas' nuances will be lost anyway. I was however looking at the sidebar entry for somewhere for some higher quality plain teas.

The one in the number one spot seems to be out of stock of a lot but I bookmarked a few things.

I'm also looking at White2tea. I'm not one of those PC types or anything but kind of find a business questionable when they've got products named pussy and lumber slut. I know I'd never name any of my products something so unprofessional. I guess it's more original than ""dragon this"" and ""dragon that"" but honestly is kind of a turn off. Are they that good?

I'm decently stocked from RoT and have multiple pounds coming from Harney as well as over a dozen more types lined up to try from them so really now I'm aiming for something high grade that stands out from the crowd.

Being as batches change over the years and what was voted on in 2016 may not apply anymore, figured I'd ask here even though the sidebar list provided some clue.

Any specific recommendations for some high quality loose leaf black, green, white and oolong teas? Something you take a sip of and are just like ""damn that's some fine tea!"" to have here and there between the cheaper stuff or to kick the day off right.

Got the matcha covered from a specialized company, some cheaper plain teas and the flavored ones. Even some cheap bags for when I'm lazy. Just want to complete the collection now.",1611174768

This time around I bought and paid $2300 worth of Matcha, and specifically asked that they ship the package with ID and signature confirmation, so that no one else but the intended recipient could receive the package.

I also bought insurance for $60, in case something should go horribly wrong

They managed to send a $2300 package without ID and signature confirmation, the USPS guy left the package ""somewhere"" and marked it as delivered, although we never received it.

Eric Gower, the owner of Breakaway Matcha refused to send out a replacement, stating that the order is too large for them to replace it. This is despite me having paid them $60 for insurance.

The only thing I can do now is to warn others about using this company, as they are dishonest and irresponsible. 

At $209 per 30 gram matcha, they probably have a 400% markup on their prices in addition.

So they had more than enough room to do the right thing and re-imburse or send out a replacement, but they chose to screw over their customers  for some quick profit. 

Now they have my $2300, while I have no Matcha. All I can say is: keep away if you can.",1611158359

First off, I plan on seasoning a Yixing pot for each of the major Oolong regions (so, a pot for Anxi/TGY, one for Dan Cong, one for Rock) and I was wondering if it would be worthwhile to do something similar for my kyusu, reserving one for sencha and getting another to season for gyokuro, etc.

Secondly, I was wondering if it's necessary or beneficial to put Tokoname through the same boiling process as Yixing (with/without tea leaves) for the initial seasoning process.

I really like Hario, and have been looking at their 300 ml and 180 ml pots. Which one would you recommend as a complement to my giant-ass 450 ml one? Iâ€™d like something that could be good for several steeps if I get into even more fancy stuff.

But I feel the quality could be better, especially with Ti Kuan Yin, which I have drank before in Mexico and I remember it tasting better there.

Aromatic wood tone, a bit like cedar, and an interesting feel made it seem unique, along with a lot of honey sweetness, which tends to make the rest approachable.  Bitterness and astringency were moderate for a 2020 sheng (which varies by lots of factors).  For this tea type the question ""is it real?"" tends to come up, which I address a little in this.

Starting with [this equation for the final temperature of two mixed liquids](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/mixing-fluids-temperature-mass-d_1785.html) I tried to reduce it down to an equation for the volume of tap water needed and thought it might be helpful to some people to share it. The equation should be

**x = (dV(100-dT)/(100-tT))**

Where:

* x is the volume of tap water required to add to the boiling water
* dV = Desired volume of water in the brewing vessel
* dT = Desired temperature of the final mixture
* tT = Temperature of water from your tap

This is done under the assumption that boiling water is 100 degrees Celcius, and you'll have to figure out how much boiling water to start with by calculating dV-x once you've solved the above equation for x.

tea,Detective-Expensive,kzxxlg,Please help me decide on aged white tea cake.,"Hello everyone! 

I want to buy an aged white tea cake. The problem is that I'm new to any kind of white teas. So far I've tasted silver needle, white peony and the Ya Bao Sheng teas, out of which the last one was the best.

Regarding the aged cakes I have my eyes on  Bai Mu Dan Shoumei Fuding,  High Mountain Gong Mei and  Gaoshan Gonmei. 

I would like to buy something that is strong (not bitter, but more like potent), and aromatic. Which one out of the listed ones would you recommend? If you could recommend any other teas, I'm open for suggestions.",1610987216
tea,DrKelsoMD,kzxe4h,Does tea get more bitter then longer it sits in the gaiwan between brews?,"I've noticed whenever I make tea gongfu, it tends to have the same bitter taste in later steeps. Normally I brew 4-8 steeps over a few hours, usually two max.

The bitterness is very similar in different teas (mostly oolong, some greens). I steep to the instructions from where I purchase so I'm not sure if I get this because it's just sitting in dry air or because of the teaware, or if that's just normal.

I also don't use a traditional gaiwan, so I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I use this [Tea Steeper](https://www.tenren.com/loose-tea-steeper.html).",1610985632

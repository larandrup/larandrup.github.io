tea,TheOnesLeftBehind,lifxyz,Review of teavivre chrysanthemum mini pu-erh,"Ripened Chrysanthemum Pu-erh Mini Tuocha, 100ml Gaiwan
Rinse 10 seconds
First steep 20 seconds
This steep produced a very dark color, which reminds me of a wood stain. It smells how the rose did as well, which is simply a slightly fishy black tea smell, I can’t smell any floral notes. The tea is smooth and mellow, no flowery notes in taste either, but it isn’t an unpleasant tea. It comes off to me like it’s a weak, or at least soft, black tea. I think maybe the tea’s are too young, though I don’t know the year, they were bought quite recently. 

Second steep 15 seconds
With the last steep I found see the line above the bottom, this time I can *just barely* see it, so it’s even darker than last time. It is slightly more astringent, though still smooth. I struggle to find much difference from the last steep. 

Third steep 15 seconds
This steep is a bit lighter again, about where the first steep was in color. Similar in taste to the second though I wonder if I notice it getting a bit sharper though. This is starting to get where I would expect a puer to be. It would be nice with a light honey. 

Fourth steep 30 seconds 
I can completely see the pattern in the bottom of my cup this time, and the tea is starting to lose strength already. I’m disappointed by this since my sister said this was the one she liked most out of the two tuocha’s she got. It is still strong though to drink satisfyingly though. It is mineral and coats your tongue. 

Fifth steep 50 seconds. More Fresh boiled water
This steep is darker, though I can still see the bottom of my cup clearly. It is more mineral and reminds me of hot stone, since it tastes the way hot stones smell to me. For me this isn’t unpleasant. It reminds me of summer days in the pool, but perhaps not everyone want to taste stone.
The smell of the leaves is even more mineral and stone like, no hints of flowers at all. 

Sixth steep 80 seconds
Only slight lighter than the last steep. The tea has taken on a fully dry taste. I feel inclined to follow each drink of tea with a mouthful of water. It is not too astringent, but it feels as though it dries my mouth. I don’t enjoy this much, but it is interesting. 

Seventh steep 150 seconds 
This steep is a deep honey color, and VERY mineral. That is the only taste to it. No mellowness to even it, it’s almost like I just boiled some stones. It’s a very strange experience. Interesting, but not for me. 

This tea did fare slightly better than the rose, although it was steeped for different times. I think if I had them side by side, steeped the same, I wouldn’t be able to tell a difference. There were no floral notes, and the petals seemed eager to slip through, this one more so due to their shape. I can’t blame anyone for that, but I would recommend a strainer to anyone who wants to make these in a Gaiwan. 

After the rinse the tea cake expanded greatly, like those compressed blocks of coconut shavings you get in small planting kits. I’ll be posting a few pictures on my new Instagram. (I won’t plug it unless it’s requested though, I always think that’s a bit annoying)

I will be trying to age these teas and see if that helps any issues I and my sister found with them. They weren’t as punchy as I expected. Considering that, I am disappointed, but it was a gentle Introduction into pu-erh. I feel a bit better prepared for the other’s that I have from her-cha.",1613150983

I've read that you can boil the water and then cool it down by either simply waiting till it cools down or by pooring it from one cup to another and then back to the initial one.

Can I start boiling the water and then stop it at 80°C before it even reaches boiling? Or is it a bad idea and I have to do one of the methods mentioned above?",1613149738

tea,JoshuaSonOfNun,lhns57,Buying Tea Online?(Amazon etc...),So I guess I moved to a town where people aren't really into tea. In my previous town I could go to certain grocery stores and find loose leaf tea. I've come to enjoy Taylor of Harrogate Earl Grey Tea loose leaf that came in a tin but have been unable to find it locally.,1613059391

tea,MardinPhoto,lhm1tr,Tea outside of the home,"Hi everyone! I’m a big fan of loose leaf oolong tea. I want to make some while at work so I can enjoy it throughout the day as I use it medicinally as well. What is everyone using for tea while you’re away from home? I love the process and I’ve been considering some sort of travel gaiwan. I usually brew it three times, so what do you do with your wet leaves between brews?",1613054520

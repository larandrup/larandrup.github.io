Second infusion there are a little bit of bitterness and the umami is still there. fouth to fifth infusion, I used 75 degrees Celsius water and 100 degree as the taste slowly fades. I like this tea a lot. Moreover, Sazen is pretty fast in delivering my tea haul.

tea,Gullywump,l3yvq2,So I accidentally got 'tea drunk'.,"I had no idea this was a thing.

Last night I decided to try some oolong that I got from my local Asian import supermarket last year. It was just a generic unbranded one - the only thing it said was 'oolong'.

About an hour after drinking it I felt like I was buzzed and as sensation akin to levitating or floating. I felt all warm and fuzzy and peaceful. But being someone who never gets high or drunk I was worried about what was happening as I'd never heard of tea having this effect. So after extensively racking my brain and googling I came across the term tea drunk, and it seemed to describe what I was feeling.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm sort of paranoid about it, because like I said I hardly drink and I've never been properly high in my life haha.

Though it was very peaceful and I had a great night's sleep for the first time in a long time (I'm an insomniac), this morning I'm still sort of feeling it. Maybe because I haven't drunk or eaten anything since that pot of tea? Definitely going to get myself some breakfast now...

* Find a smaller gaiwan, and only use 2-3g of tea to fill the gaiwan and brew 10 super small cups of tea. I can't seem to find a small gaiwan anywhere...

* Just stick to western method? I guess I can just do this, but I feel like i'll be missing out on some alternatives to discover more tea flavors...

tea,mmmmmmmmnope,l3qf90,What‚Äôs your solution to the ‚Äútea floaters‚Äù issue?,"I‚Äôve recently began to get very very into tea- but as I‚Äôve been learning, I‚Äôve also discovered an unfortunate issue. I‚Äôm hoping that you all have some good solutions, and I think you probably do! 

I‚Äôve recently learned about the microplastics issue with teabags- that when a lot of brands of tea are heated up, they release millions of tiny microplastics. Definitely not what I want to be drinking. 

Because of this issue, I‚Äôve been cutting open my tea bags and dumping them into various tea strainers- and I have some loose leaf teas that I‚Äôve always done this with. 

When I use metal strainers with my tea, I get little floaters in the top of my cup. They get in my mouth and it just ruins my experience. I‚Äôve had this issue even with extremely fine metal strainers, unfortunately. 

I can get a pretty smooth experience by using cheesecloth, but it‚Äôs specialty, and a little expensive where I live. I‚Äôm also reading that the best tea needs to have space to breathe when the water expands the leaves, and most tea bags don‚Äôt allow for that.

tea,ianthus,l3civh,Teaware similar to Shelley's ?,"Hello everyone.

I've recently discover the Shelley antique teacups, and especially the Wileman series. I love the particular shapes they have (cf Dainty or queen Anne sets for example). However, being antiques, they can be hard to find and/or expensive.
Would you happen to know of any other brand that has produced or produces today teaware with such special shapes?",1611410290

Anyway, what I'd like to know is, is it advisable to grandpa black teas? I would imagine no as they'd become much stronger much quicker. But if anyone has tried it and would like to provide some insight that'd be great.",1611407135
tea,Farisa_TheLadyKnight,l3bcp4,Quince Tea,"Hello all.
I recently tried out a sample of Tea Forte's ""Darjeerling Quince"" and they're out of stock. I tried to look for an equivalent on Adagio, but haven't found anything. Also, I've checked on the web and can't find teas with Quince in them. 

If anyone knows Quince tea blends, please comment below. I am in love with the scent and flavor of this wonderful fruit! Below is the product link.

You can even talk about non-tea related topics; maybe you want advice on a guy/gal, or just to talk about life in general.",1611403217

It came today and I'm trying the Irish Breakfast Tea (loose leaf)... I don't know if I'm making it wrong or if I just don't really care for it. Up til now I've mostly only had Bigelow Green Teas and Chamomile Tea. 

The Irish Breakfast Tea can says 1 tsp per 8oz. My mug is around 15oz so I did 2 tsp. I'm used to strong black coffee so I tried it first with nothing added and wasn't sure if I liked it. It says it goes well with milk and sugar. I can't have dairy so I used some coconut milk creamer. Still wasn't too good so I added coconut sugar (cuz I try to limit sugar) and that was a mistake. So then I googled Irish Breakfast Tea. Read about traditionally the milk was put in the cup first (about 1/3 of the cup) and that it's better that way. Made another cup with the coconut milk creamer in the cup first. No sugar this time. And I still don't care for it.

Any suggestions, or should I just say I don't like this tea? I'm willing to keep trying it in different ways, just not sure what else to try.",1614887342

The experience was awesome! The tea is... very good but I've had way better oolongs. But I'm buying this again for sure! The good thing is that the tea is very flavourful - it's not a fragrant water like the Taiwanese oolongs I praise so much. The dry leaves had an amazing fragrance. The wet leaves were even more fragrant (duh), but... I brewed this for 30s - 30s - 40s and I can't smell almost anything in the liqueur. Ok a little exaggerated, I can, but it's a little underwhelming after smeling the leaves. It's very floral and it reminds me of Ya Shi Dancong but without the dry mouthfeel. I'm oversteeping it a little - did 90 seconds for the 6th steep and I love it. I'm a fan of very watery and weak oolongs, so I can say that this oolong is very smooth even oversteeped! There is some good punch that I can't call bitter or astringent (probably some super low level of bitterness/astringency/acidity combined into an amazing mouthfeel). I recommend this for sure!

I live in the US and some years ago  received a T2 loose leaf tea sampler from Australian relatives and loved the teas.

Fast forward to now - we have a T2 tea shop in our area and I purchased a 50 pk bag of Melbourne Breakfast in tea bags. It was 50 percent off due to what I thought was an expiry date issue, but when I use these tea bags, they always rip open when the tag is being separated from the paper teabag, no matter how careful I am. I look at the tea bags and they are actually so thin, I think there are holes elsewhere in the bag, notwithstanding.

This is okay for personal use, as I put it in a strainer (and I add some extra Madagascar Vanilla loose leaf T2 as well!), but wondering if anyone know if the poor quality tea bag is a consistent issue with this brand? If it is, I wouldn't want to give boxed tea in bags as a gift, for example, or even pay full price for it for my own use.",1614868824

tea,ProbablyNotPoisonous,lxgitk,Yet another oolong question from a beginner,"I have a small assortment of oolong teas from Song Tea and Dachi Tea. I have been brewing gongfu style and have been underwhelmed, so I decided recently to go through them again brewing according to the package directions (shocking, I know), which mostly means lower leaf-to-water ratios and longer steep times than with gongfu. I'm not drinking them in any particular order, just deciding based on my mood.

For water, I'm using bottled ""National Artesian Water"" brand bottled water. Claims to have a 7.8 pH, for whatever that's worth. Tastes a hell of a lot better than filtered tap water, anyway.

Brewing vessel is a small double-walled glass mug with a lid.

The first tea I tried this with was [Dachi Verdant Valley](https://dachitea.co/product/verdant-valley/), which is a Taiwanese high mountain oolong. Package instructions: 5g tea, 150 ml water, 194 F (rounded to 190 on my kettle), 1-2 minutes. I was blown away by the result!

* Smells *exactly* like blooming lilacs, especially on the first couple of steeps

* Mild bitterness and intense sugary-sweet aftertaste on the first steep

* Subsequent steeps: bitterness disappears; tea now has a fresh, green taste with, indeed, cantaloupe-like aromatics. Finish is less intense, but still quite sweet and pleasant.

* Not the creamiest texture; but still noticably more so than plain water.

* Petered out after 5 or 6 infusions; I wasn't actually counting.

Tonight I tried [2018 Meizhan Yancha](https://songtea.com/products/meizhan-yancha) from Song Tea. Package instructions: 5g tea, 150 ml water, 205 F, 1 min 30 seconds. My kettle has settings for 200 and ""boil,"" but nothing between. I started at 200, but then increased to ""boil, but pour into another cup for a few moments,"" and then just straight boiling water, because - I got very little flavor from this tea other than faint minerals. Increasing the temperature yielded a very faint fruity aroma, but nothing I would call ""dark"" or ""intense."" Also not much ""thickness"" to the mouthfeel, which seems weird because Song Tea specifically calls that out in their description.

So what gives?

Theories:

* Maybe the yancha is just old? I've read it doesn't keep well (but then, I've also read it does). I store my tea in its original, opaque, airtight packaging; but it gets hot here in summer, so heat might be an issue.

* Maybe the water isn't hot enough, despite what my kettle claims?

* Maybe the tea is relatively lower-quality to begin with, and Song Tea is overselling it in the description? Certainly it's not very expensive for a yancha.

* Maybe I'm just inexperienced and expecting too much/comparing it unfairly to the (imho) very sweet and beginner-friendly Dachi high mountain oolong? I don't know *much,* but I know oolong is a massive category and high mountain oolongs are very different from rock oolongs.

tea,josqvin,lx087f,Chinese Black Tea Question: Souchong vs Congou,"Souchong (xiao zhong, meaning ""small type"") refers specifically to a small leaf varietal tea plant found in the Wuyi area and its surroundings. The first black teas were made from this plant in that area and are often found with the moniker ""lapsang"" (zhen shan, meaning ""true mountain"") to specify the Wuyi origin. (Note that a genuine lapsang souchong will not always be smoked.) The most famous souchong tea now is probably Jin Jun Mei. 

Congou (gong fu, meaning ""with skill"") refers to black teas also made in the same area, e.g. Bai lin gongfu or tan yang gong fu, which are both Fujian origin teas (collectively known as ""minhong gongfu""). However teas from other provinces frequently have the ""gongfu"" or congou name attached, i.e. Keemun gongfu (from Anhui) and Ninghong gongfu (from Jianxi, which borders on Wuyi). These two other can be explained as an extension of the Fujian gongfu black tea tradition, I would think. However, I have also seen teas from yunnan adopt the moniker--Dianhong gongfu. 

It would seem that congou or gongfu style black tea making represents some kind of refinement or advancement of the original souchong black tea production style. This would also explain the name. However, I would be grateful if someone could provide additional information as to the origins and relationship between these two types of black tea.

This change came after the US decided to withdrawal itself from the Universal Postal Union for unfair advantages for countries like China that could send a package from across the world for cheaper than the national interstate postage rate.

The UPU and the USA came to an agreement for the US to remain under the condition that it could charge a flat rate to all countries wishing to ship into the US market.

Other countries have also expressed interest in incorporating this into their own countries. So you should keep an eye on the news from your own countries as well. 

Lastly, I think this will affect Chinese teas the most as they are going to see the biggest changes in cost. Companies there will have to decide if they want to raise their prices by a lot, or offer shipping at much higher rates than before. Unless the government subsidizes the changes. 

The increase for Japanese teas should only be about $4-5 per package. So if you are a Mr. Moneybags it might not be a big deal. But if your just buying a little 50g sample, your now gonna need an extra $11.50 for shipping instead of $8.",1614734477

Let's say you brew gong fu style and use on average 5g tealeaves per litre of water. That will lead to 200 litres of tea per 1kg of leaves. Assuming a very budget friendly tea of 50‚Ç¨/kg (my current somewhat daily drinker tie guan yin costs as much) that will leave us with a cost/litre of 25 cents.

Now onto coffee: let's say you use pour-over style brewing and use 50g coffee per 1 litre of water (I am not a coffee expert but I heard that pros even use 60g/litre for pour-over, so 50g should be reasonable). This means we can achieve 20 litres of finished coffee from 1kg of beans.  
Assuming a kg of cheap supermarket coffee (in Germany, so maybe your prices vary) of 6‚Ç¨/kg, that leaves us with a price / litre of 30 cents.

tl;dr tea is way cheaper than coffee",1614278076

tea,galactalism,lpt6yw,How much do you spend?,"Hi friends,

I‚Äôm wondering how much do you guys pay per gram of really good tea with strong cha Qi sustainably and responsibly grown and all that? 

Is it worth it to you?

I‚Äôve been getting a lot of really positive benefits from my Gong Fu Tea and meditation practice over the last couple years. I‚Äôm just concerned that maybe I‚Äôm over paying trying to drink some of the finer teas. Yunnan sourcing is cheaper and has some wonderful teas. 

Sometimes I like to order from Living Tea which is more expensive but has a good selection of high vibration teas. I like clean teas. Sometimes old growth and/or aged. 

So I just payed 0.59 cents per gram of a selection of 2 Dian Hongs and one Oolong from Living Tea (including the shipping charge) it was 115 dollars for 196 grams of Tea total. Is this okay or do you think I‚Äôm overpaying? 

Does anyone recommend where to find very good quality and clean teas that are cheaper or is this just how much it should cost? 

Thank you!",1614012429

In truth, im trying to reduce how much juice, coffee, soda I drink. I thought tea might be a nice alternative to just plain old water if I just keep it unsweetened or tightly control added sugar. 

My question to you guys is how you would go about preparing it

- Do you think brewing it hot and just letting it cool is the way to go?

- Or would you just leave the tea in water in the fridge or at room temp? I even heard about some people leaving tea in the sun for some reason?

- on that thought, how bout water to tea ratio? Honestly, im planning to just use some cheap fruit flavored tea bags to try and keep it somewhat economical because its going to be for everyday drinking. Would you just do 1 bag per 8 oz of water?

- Any thoughts about what types of tea and or flavors would be good for this? Honestly, im completely inexperienced with tea because I live in FL and generally drink cold stuff because of the weather.

So I just had my first cup, ok two cups, of Tao of Teas first flush Darjeeling. And I see I have been missing something in my life. This is the first loose leaf tea I have ever made. So I am want to learn more to see what I should try next. 

I am looking for good black teas. No green teas for me. When I was stationed in Japan, the green tea would always give me a splitting headache.

Now, I know ""you get what you pay for"" is usually true. But I am not to the point of paying top dollar. I just want something that is enjoyable. So as awesome as a place like the Art of Teas sounds, most of their stuff seems beyond what I want to pay for now. At least until I narrow down what blends I like. 

I have looked at Harney &amp; Sons, Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate, and Vahdam. From reading around r/teas, it seems like Twinings  would not be a great option. I also need a little help figuring out what type to try next. There are just so many options. I would prefer something I can drink straight with no sugar, honey, or milk.

I‚Äôm looking for a black tea with low astringency but also with a nice mouthfeel and moderate complexly. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

H&amp;S English Breakfast: This is actually my favorite daily drinker (especially considering the price). H&amp;S says they this is a Keemun blend, so I figured that maybe I should find a higher grade Keemun. This led me to...

TeaVivre Keemun Grade 1: This is a nice, complex tea, but it has a moderate malt flavor, which I‚Äôm not quite sold on.

TeaVivre Lapsang Souchong Wild Black Tea: Extremely malty and sweet. Not at all what I was expecting!

YS Black Gold, YS Golden Monkey, YS High Mountain Red Ai Lao: All three of these teas are quite malty and hard to distinguish from each other (to my perhaps unrefined palate).

YS Wild Tree Purple: Really enjoyed this tea as it had only a hint of malt and is dominated by floral notes, but still tastes like a black tea. Would definitely buy again.

Pleasantly surprised my order arrived safely to UK in 22  days. If this was the case, I might have bought a smaller batch.

Just a brief summary as I haven‚Äôt tasted all the tea.

Good wrapping, they even threw in a free Pu-erh which is nice.

I  tried the Pure Gold Jin Jun Mei Black Tea of Tong Mu Guan Village  first, very good tea. The leaves were very delicate, so fuzzy and the  flavour was malty and sweet. More chocolaty and biscuit flavour than  expected, however it does have this medicinal after taste that I find in  some black teas and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me brewing it wrong, but  this is one expensive tea I wish I would enjoy more. Anyone else tried  the tea please let me know your thoughts?

My  only complaint is the Classic Wenge Wood Tea Table I bought is wonky.  The actual wood itself is very sturdy, heavy and well made. Really loved  it, until to my horror, when making my first brew my teaware was  wobbling around. Not impressed and have emailed Scott to see if they  will do anything about, not expensive, but majorly disappointed as I  won‚Äôt be using if it's unstable.

It tasted great both before and after I added a splash of milk and a little sugar (although in different ways). The problem is, I'm used to drinking a big ~700ml mug of coffee, so I was left wanting for more once I had finished the 200ml cup. Finally the actual question; Should I boil 600 ml of water and pour it over 3 tea bags in one cup, or boil 600 ml of water and pour 200 ml into 3 different cups, then after they've steeped pour them together?

How to make a teaboy timer with a microwave oven and a string.... 

I often forget to get my tea after the timer signal and then I have to make a new cup of tea because it gets to strong.

I was planning to build a digital teaboy that on timer,  lift up the tea from the cup.

But then I did an experiment with my digital micro oven that worked great.

I put my tea cup on the edge of the round plate in the micro that rotate and the put a long string on the teabag. 

I then made a lid over the cup so that it had a hole in the middle and put the teabag hanging down and put the cup at the inner edge of the round plate.

Then I pulled the string out of the micro until the teabag was just under the lidhole and over the water in the cup.

Then I closed the door so that the string was stuck in the door.

Then I adjusted the timer and effect so that the teabag was going up and down in the cup, 

as the cup  rotated,  in the micro wave oven, my favorit 4 minuts and when the time stopped the cup stopped at the inner part of the micro oven where the teabag was hanging over the water.

So now I never forget the tea to get to strong.

I now use a high thermos cup so even if I forget  my tea for a period the tea will still be hot in the micro oven when I go and get it.

I made some videos on the process.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnblraThxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnblraThxg)

I think it is a great idea for people who do not want to waste tea.

tea,dohrey,lr8vhb,Crowd sourcing a comprehensive guide to tea freshness and when to consume tea at its best,"For people who buy higher end teas I think it is only natural to want to consume that tea (that you've spent hard earned money on) when it is at its absolute best. But I've never seen an exhaustive guide on how this applies to different tea types (at best, a guide might examine the broad categories of tea and tell you their maximum storage times, but won't take into account very specific types). So I'm hoping others can input into this guide I've made based on my experience and what I've read in various places to create a crowd sourced guide and fill in the blanks (indicated by question marks) where I haven't seen much guidance, add in more categories you think I've missed and correct me if you think I'm wrong. But my ideas are below. I have also put in some notes on proper storage at the bottom.

**Green tea**

- *Chinese, Japanese and Korean green tea*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.

**Yellow tea**

- *Huangshan yellow tea*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1.5 years if stored properly.
- *Yunnan yellow tea*: ???

**Oolong tea**

- *Lightly oxidised and unroasted oolong (e.g. Taiwanese high mountain and tie guan yin)*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Highly oxidised but unroasted oolong (e.g. certain Taiwanese and Indian/Nepalese oolongs)*: From personal experience I find they are best consumed anytime within 1 year of harvest, but can be potentially ok for up to 2 years.
- *Medium roasted oolongs (e.g. some Taiwanese, Dancong oolong, and very light Wuyi oolongs)*: Best to wait for at least a month or so after harvest for roast flavours to dissipate a bit. Best consumed within 1 year of harvest to maintain floral notes. 
- *Highly roasted oolongs (e.g. most Wuyi oolongs)*: Generally considered best to wait for 6 months to a year after harvest for roast flavours to dissipate a bit. Generally good for a few years.

*Footnote*: some people like aged oolongs (stored cool and dry). Seems general consensus is lightly oxidised oolongs don't age well, and roasted oolongs age better. Probably takes about 10 years for noticeable aged flavours to come through.

**Black tea**

- *First flush Darjeelings (and probably other very heavily wilted/lightly oxidised black teas)*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 9 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Second flush Darjeelings/Nilgiri teas*: Best consumed within a year of harvest. Probably generally ok for up to 1.5-2 years.
- *Autumn flush Darjeelings/Assams/other heavily oxidised and malty Indian/Nepalese/Sri Lankan/African teas*: I find it is best for these to rest for 1-2 months before consuming to allow flavours to come together. Generally ok to consume for at least 2 years.
- *Delicate/floral Chinese black teas (e.g. Jin Jun Mei and other Fujian teas) and Taiwanese black teas*: Best consumed 1-2 months after harvest to let overly ""fresh"" flavours dissipate a bit. Ideally consumed within 9 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Robust Chinese black teas (e.g. in particular dian hongs)*: Best consumed c.6 months after harvest to allow resting and flavours to come together. Generally ok to consume for at least 2 years.
- *Sun dried black teas (shian hong) and black teas made from puerh varietals*: Best consumed 1-3 years after harvest to allow flavours to develop. Whether longer term aging would be beneficial seems debatable.
- *Japanese black teas*: ???

**White tea**

- *Silver needle and bai mu dan*: Up to personal preference. Consumed within 6 months to a year of harvest the tea will be more floral and fresh. After that, the tea will start to age and develop more oxidised flavours. No real maximum aging time as long as the tea is stored properly.
- *Lower grade white tea (shou mei, gong mei)*: probably best aged for at least a few years. Aging has real effect after 3-5 years. No real maximum aging time as long as the tea is stored properly.

**Puerh tea/Hei cha**

- *Raw puerh*: Some is designed to be drunk young and should be consumed within 18 months to keep ""fresh"" flavours. Most raw puerh benefits from aging. Generally considered to have developed some aged character after 5-7 years depending on storage conditions. 
- *Ripe puerh*: Generally best to wait a year after production for fermentation tastes to dissipate. Aging has some effect but not as big as raw puerh. Maximum storage time (where aging may have beneficial effects) debatable but probably at least 10 years.
- *Other hei cha*: ???

**Notes on storage**

For basically all teas the keys to good storage are: 

(1) Avoid light. Keep the tea in a dark place and opaque packaging.

(2) Avoid humidity. If you live in a humid area putting dessicant packs in your tea containers is probably a good idea.

(3) Avoid too much heat. A relatively cool place is best, and don't keep it near a heater or cooker. Some will recommend keeping green teas and greener oolongs in the fridge. I think it is debatable how beneficial this is (given it can encourage condensation on the tea) if you don't live somewhere super hot.

(4) Avoid strong smells. Tea will soak up smells very easily, so sealed packaging away from strong smells like cleaning products, spices, perfumes etc is best.

(5) Avoid oxygen. Keeping teas in a sealed airtight container without much air space will be fine for most teas. For green teas and light oolongs you could consider vacuum packing or using oxygen absorbers for optimal storage.

The main exception to this is puerh where some airflow and humidity is good for storage. How much exactly is a hugely controversial and detailed topic!",1614159764

tea,dohrey,lq0rwb,How long after harvest is black tea at its best?,"There seems to be a lot of conflicting information out there on when black tea is best to drink after its harvested. 

It seems clear very light black teas like Darjeelings should be treated like green teas and basically consumed ASAP after harvest, but for others it's not so clear it seems. E.g. Yunnan Sourcing seems to suggest Yunnan black teas are best at least 6 months to a year after harvest, but then others seem to think black teas basically just stay the same for around 2-3 years after harvest and then start to decline. Some other black teas seem to be specifically designed to be aged (e.g. compressed black teas).

What's your experience around this? Have any of you experimented tasting teas at different periods after harvest and found anything interesting?

I am basically debating whether or not to hold off on buying some black tea from Yunnan Sourcing until after the spring harvest when I can get 2021 teas, or just buying 2020 harvested teas now.",1614030074

Rinse 10 seconds
First steep 20 seconds
This steep produced a very dark color, which reminds me of a wood stain. It smells how the rose did as well, which is simply a slightly fishy black tea smell, I can‚Äôt smell any floral notes. The tea is smooth and mellow, no flowery notes in taste either, but it isn‚Äôt an unpleasant tea. It comes off to me like it‚Äôs a weak, or at least soft, black tea. I think maybe the tea‚Äôs are too young, though I don‚Äôt know the year, they were bought quite recently. 

Second steep 15 seconds
With the last steep I found see the line above the bottom, this time I can *just barely* see it, so it‚Äôs even darker than last time. It is slightly more astringent, though still smooth. I struggle to find much difference from the last steep. 

Third steep 15 seconds
This steep is a bit lighter again, about where the first steep was in color. Similar in taste to the second though I wonder if I notice it getting a bit sharper though. This is starting to get where I would expect a puer to be. It would be nice with a light honey. 

Fourth steep 30 seconds 
I can completely see the pattern in the bottom of my cup this time, and the tea is starting to lose strength already. I‚Äôm disappointed by this since my sister said this was the one she liked most out of the two tuocha‚Äôs she got. It is still strong though to drink satisfyingly though. It is mineral and coats your tongue. 

Fifth steep 50 seconds. More Fresh boiled water
This steep is darker, though I can still see the bottom of my cup clearly. It is more mineral and reminds me of hot stone, since it tastes the way hot stones smell to me. For me this isn‚Äôt unpleasant. It reminds me of summer days in the pool, but perhaps not everyone want to taste stone.
The smell of the leaves is even more mineral and stone like, no hints of flowers at all. 

Sixth steep 80 seconds
Only slight lighter than the last steep. The tea has taken on a fully dry taste. I feel inclined to follow each drink of tea with a mouthful of water. It is not too astringent, but it feels as though it dries my mouth. I don‚Äôt enjoy this much, but it is interesting. 

Seventh steep 150 seconds 
This steep is a deep honey color, and VERY mineral. That is the only taste to it. No mellowness to even it, it‚Äôs almost like I just boiled some stones. It‚Äôs a very strange experience. Interesting, but not for me. 

This tea did fare slightly better than the rose, although it was steeped for different times. I think if I had them side by side, steeped the same, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell a difference. There were no floral notes, and the petals seemed eager to slip through, this one more so due to their shape. I can‚Äôt blame anyone for that, but I would recommend a strainer to anyone who wants to make these in a Gaiwan. 

After the rinse the tea cake expanded greatly, like those compressed blocks of coconut shavings you get in small planting kits. I‚Äôll be posting a few pictures on my new Instagram. (I won‚Äôt plug it unless it‚Äôs requested though, I always think that‚Äôs a bit annoying)

I will be trying to age these teas and see if that helps any issues I and my sister found with them. They weren‚Äôt as punchy as I expected. Considering that, I am disappointed, but it was a gentle Introduction into pu-erh. I feel a bit better prepared for the other‚Äôs that I have from her-cha.",1613150983

Any of you that live in EU (or more specifically Germany) and make their own tea blends at home?  


A bit of context: I'm not so much of a traditional tea drinker as I only allow myself to drink black/green/white tea in the mornings and even though I enjoy them pure, I also like teas with flavors. So naturally, I omit the ""wake up"" tea and drink just herbal, floral, or fruit tea in the afternoons/evenings. My partner also enjoys those worm or as iced tea, so we go through a few teapots a day in this stay at home situation.  


There are a lot of places that I bought and I can buy the actual tea base - quality and safe for drinking, for when I want that caffeine. But my question is about the rest:   


Where are you sourcing your non-tea tea ingredients from - herbs, floral, dried fruit? Anything specific I should be looking for to check if they are suitable for steeping?

I don't know if anyone knows what I'm talking about, but in the restaurants it came in little covered cups with a metal stick that you'd use to just get a pinch of the powder and then you'd use the hot water on tap to make the tea.

How is the difference between culinary grade and ceremonial grade matcha? I've only tried culinary for my matcha at home and I've been rather indifferent to it but I heard ceremony grade makes a difference.

What are some general recommendations for well caffeinated teas that will be easy on my stomach? Where can I buy them?

Wild-origin teas are an interesting subject that I've said a lot about tied to different examples.  The genetics of the plants varies a lot, and some of it isn't that close to standard Assamica used to make sheng (seemingly; processing and terroir differences factor in too).  

This version was sweet, heavy on citrus fruit, clean and balanced, with good intensity, and a really creamy feel (so a bit like an oolong, really).  Bitterness and astringency were quite low, typical for what I've tried of vaguely related teas.  A hint of tartness was unusual, but often versions are more atypical than that, sometimes sour instead, which can take some getting used to.  This tea was really pleasant, something I would like to drink regularly.

This sub got me curious about gongfu so I watched a video all about how brewing gongfu style basically makes tea exponentially better ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNO\_v8L2vI4&amp;ab\_channel=MeiLeaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNO_v8L2vI4&amp;ab_channel=MeiLeaf)). 

From the video, it seemed like the main difference is that gongfu uses way more tea leaves for the same amount of water and uses a shorter steeping time. So I was wondering if I would get a similar effect by putting a lot of tea in my western tea strainer (I have a large strainer that fits in my cup and would be easy to put more leaves in) then take the strainer out sooner. I could then re-steep like that for each cup. I know there is more involved in gongfu brewing like careful timing, water temps, aesthetics, etc. but would the process I suggested produce similar results? Am I missing a crucial aspect with this?

I may invest in a gongfu set at some point as I fall farther down the tea rabbit hole, but for now I'm wondering if there's a good way to get a feel for the different brewing results without buying any new equipment.",1613327013

So i figured i'd try to brew this Sencha green tea I had at home (it's loose leaf and it had like rose buds and strawberry) and it looked very nice so I was pretty excited.

The first time I brew it, it was very weak and it tasted kind of weird (I think I used too much water and i shouldn't have used tap water).

So second brewing, I used more tea and after I seeped it, it smelled heavenly. I was so happy!  But, unsurprisingly, the tea was soooo bitter. I legit couldnt drink it. I used way too much tea and I think the water was too hot. I also think I let it steep for too long.

So, third time's the charm, right? Nope. I used 2 grams of tea (one teaspoon) for 6 oz of water. Water was at 170F. I let it steep for around 2 minutes. And i was so sure it was going to taste good but, sadly, it was even worse than the first time. It literally tasted like water so i just squeezed some drops of lemon into it and now I have a weird hot lemonade.

&amp;#x200B;

Am i doing something wrong? Could it be the tea? I really just wanted some nice tea. Please help.",1613795348

tea,BlankVerse,ln1k2i,Cold Brew Tea brew time?,"I generally like my regular tea cold, and my herb teas hot. 

So I purchased some Lipton (yeah, I know) Cold Brew and Iced Tea bags. The instructions for the Iced Tea were pretty much what you'd expect. 

1. 4 cups of boiling water over 2 large tea bags 
2. brew for 3-5 minutes, then remove bags
3. sweeten to taste
4. Stir in 6 cups of ice cubes

Makes 2 quarts of very Liptony ice tea.

Now the instructions fir the cold brew confused me. I'd already read a bunch of posts here and on the internet about cold brewing tea. And they all say for cold brew use 1.5-2x the amount of tea leaves you'd use for hot tea, and steep for anywhere from 4-24 hours depending upon the tea.

First off the Lipton Cold Brew actually has less tea than the Iced Tea version (6.2g vs 7.1g).

Then the instructions say:

1) Pour 2 cups water over 2 tea bags

Cold water? Luke warm tap water?

2) Brew 3 minutes, stir, remove tea bags

3) Sweaten to taste, add ice.

Just 3 minutes!?

I tried that and although it was stronger than I expected, it was still fairly weak tea in my opinion.

So I thought what if I left the bags in longer. After 2 hours the tea was just about right. After 4 hours it was starting to taste a little bitter, but I continued. After 6 hours it was fairly bitter and strong, so I took out the bags. I now had cold tea that required lots of honey to sweeten. ;)

What is everyone else's experience with brewing cold brew tea and particularly Lipton Cold Brew?

----

What about other teas, especially herb teas. 

Just for fun I decided to make cold herb tea using the Iced Tea method above, using 2 quarts hot water over 8 random herb tea bags since 2 qt=8 cups. and then cooling. That turned out pretty strong and dominated by the ginger tea I included (but I did not mind that since I enjoy ginger tea). I liked the end result. It was tasty. Next time I might try 8 bags in 3 quarts to make it less strong. And maybe even actually cold brew in the refrigerator.

tea,BioStore,lmd6zw,Herbal medicine,"Indigenous people worldwide, revere much of the natural world as sacred. And rely on its elements to ease many **health problemes**. For much of humankind, especially in the groves of africa, possessing plant knowledge, or having access to a person who did, made the difference between life and death. In fact, the majority of the world still relies on traditional medicine, and even in industrialized countries, folk remedies are still used to treat illness everyday.

It's not a surprise then, in these modern times with the growing options of **medical technology,** that there‚Äôs a rising movement to restore ancient plant-based healing practices. Having access to modern healthcare is not easy, costs are skyrocketing and the quality of medical care is degrading in developed countries, let alone the tird world, leading a large population to seek alternatives outside of the mainstream medical system. Herbal medicine might be a more accessible solution.

There are many different systems of traditional medicine, and the philosophy and practices of each are influenced by the prevailing conditions, and geographic area within which it first evolved. The commun property of all the systems is there emphasis on the equilibrium of the mind, body, and the environment. Generally, the focus is on the overall condition of the individual, rather than on the particular ailment or disease from which the patient is suffering, and the use of herbs is a core part of treatment.

Traditional Chinese medicine is an important example of how ancient knowledge is applied in a holistic approach. Treatments are based on a large view of the patient, expressed in terms of the balance of yin and yang. Yin represents the earth, cold, and femininity, whereas yang represents the sky, heat, and masculinity. The actions of yin and yang influence the interactions of the five elements composing the universe: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The practitioners seek to control the yin and yang levels and the energy through the body by making recourse to herbal remedies.

In modern days, the usage of **natural products** other than vitamins and minerals are the most commonly used alternative medicines, because they are widely perceived as natural, safe, more affordable, closely corresponding to the patient‚Äôs ideology and allaying concerns about the adverse effects of chemical (synthetic) medicines.

Last night I decided to try some oolong that I got from my local Asian import supermarket last year. It was just a generic unbranded one - the only thing it said was 'oolong'.

About an hour after drinking it I felt like I was buzzed and as sensation akin to levitating or floating. I felt all warm and fuzzy and peaceful. But being someone who never gets high or drunk I was worried about what was happening as I'd never heard of tea having this effect. So after extensively racking my brain and googling I came across the term tea drunk, and it seemed to describe what I was feeling.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm sort of paranoid about it, because like I said I hardly drink and I've never been properly high in my life haha.

Though it was very peaceful and I had a great night's sleep for the first time in a long time (I'm an insomniac), this morning I'm still sort of feeling it. Maybe because I haven't drunk or eaten anything since that pot of tea? Definitely going to get myself some breakfast now...

* Find a smaller gaiwan, and only use 2-3g of tea to fill the gaiwan and brew 10 super small cups of tea. I can't seem to find a small gaiwan anywhere...

* Just stick to western method? I guess I can just do this, but I feel like i'll be missing out on some alternatives to discover more tea flavors...

tea,mmmmmmmmnope,l3qf90,What‚Äôs your solution to the ‚Äútea floaters‚Äù issue?,"I‚Äôve recently began to get very very into tea- but as I‚Äôve been learning, I‚Äôve also discovered an unfortunate issue. I‚Äôm hoping that you all have some good solutions, and I think you probably do! 

I‚Äôve recently learned about the microplastics issue with teabags- that when a lot of brands of tea are heated up, they release millions of tiny microplastics. Definitely not what I want to be drinking. 

Because of this issue, I‚Äôve been cutting open my tea bags and dumping them into various tea strainers- and I have some loose leaf teas that I‚Äôve always done this with. 

When I use metal strainers with my tea, I get little floaters in the top of my cup. They get in my mouth and it just ruins my experience. I‚Äôve had this issue even with extremely fine metal strainers, unfortunately. 

I can get a pretty smooth experience by using cheesecloth, but it‚Äôs specialty, and a little expensive where I live. I‚Äôm also reading that the best tea needs to have space to breathe when the water expands the leaves, and most tea bags don‚Äôt allow for that.

White vanilla Grapefruit, Harney &amp; Sons, White Tea:

Temp: 82c / 179 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 3 min

I'm not sure precisely where I got this tea since I've never bought Harney &amp; Sons before but I'm pretty sure that I 'borrowed' it from my workplace when the pandemic started. And for the price I payed it's pretty good. Upon opening the package I could immediately smell an unexpected strong musty smell that nicely transferred over to the actual brew. I'm unsure what precise ingredient give the tea this flavour, but it's a style that I'm definitely a fan of in black teas. Aside from the musky notes, this tea has quite the long lasting aftertaste which lingers pleasantly for several minutes after the initial tastes of vanilla have dispersed. I don't know if I agree with the description of this tea as grapefruit flavoured any more then I'd call bergamot grapefruit flavoured, but this blend definitely has a passing relationship with the light and airy notes of citrus. I would not recommend adding any sugar what-so-ever to this tea. I found that adding some turned the naturally strong and vibrant tastes into a cloying and suppressed flavour.     

Surprisingly enough the aforementioned mustiness of the tea does work when the tea is cold if that's something you're inclined to like, as I do, however I suspect that this iced tea is not for everyone. The same warning for sugar applies to this tea when iced; I didn't even finish my sugared cup of iced tea and I will not be adding sugar to it in the future.      

A word of warning for you all, the packaging and the website both say to steep it for 2 to 3 minutes with at a standard temperature for a white tea and they are not joking. The tetrahedral teabag helps it to brew quickly. I only steeped it for barely 3 minutes and it seemed a little too strong for my tastes, so this is not a tea that you can walk away from.     

I expect that I'll continue to have drink this tea if it's offered to me or if I find myself in the mood for something a little different, however this the will not be replacing my standard black teas nor will it be one of my recommendations for new tea drinkers. This is definitely a better choice for the a more refined palette looking for a boldly flavoured and textured tea.

I also have random mixes of wet chai, herbal teas, Yerba mate, and even some of those herbal tea jars you get from Asian groceries (citrus, ginger, ginseng)

tea,YSS2020,l2zpna,"Loose leaf tea ""serving"" question..","I'm a little confused by say, Harney and Republic of Tea. They as well as a couple sites mention using one teaspoon per cup of tea. That would kind of make the word ""teaspoon"" make sense but, a teaspoon is only around 1 gram or so on average, maybe 1.5.

The same companies will sell 100 grams and say it makes 40-50 cups which is about 2g per cup. Most people also say simply 2-3g per cup.

I right off the bat just went by weight not volume and it's still a little weaker than I generally make my teas. I couldn't imagine only using one teaspoon.

I'm not sure but anyone have an idea why these companies say to use one teaspoon of leaf? Is there a special ""teaspoon"" not equivalent to the US measurement teaspoon that I'm missing?

I really don't care for myself. A digital scale is fine. I'm partially thinking of the bad reviews left by people talking about their tea tasting like hot water which would be expected when the company says to use one third to one half the amount of tea intended.

Volume-wise for loose leaf, a tablespoon generally winds up between 2-3g.

If anything maybe this will show up in google search results for people wondering why their loose leaf tea tastes like barely flavored hot water.

But, upon inspection and brewing, the leaf is in these hard charcoal colored pellets, and even after a few brews, the pellets do not unravel or even expand much in size! As for the taste and color, it has that characteristic dark, pinkish hue of ripe puer. The aroma literally smells like some kind of Chinese restaurant stir fry garlic sesame vegetables dish you'd find in the strip mall of middle America. The taste is extremely dry and vegetal, kind of like bland stir fry broccoli or something. The wife doesn't even think it is tea at all, but it does seem somewhat similar to ripe puer I've had in the past and I think I feel caffeine.

While I wouldn't describe this tea as bland or bad in the slightest it failed to make much of an impact on me even though I'm personally quite fond of black teas in general and English breakfast in particular. This Private Selections blend was smooth and even with great tolerance for under and over steeping which just may be what you're looking for especially if you're looking for a solid safe bet for a nice cuppa tea.     

This tea was nicely complimented by adding just a dash of sugar (and I do mean a dash, a lit bit goes a long way with this blend) and the profile of this tea worked nicely when I had it cold with or without sugar. If you're looking for a blend to have for iced tea on a hot day, this is an excellent choice.

Tasting is the only effective method, through the normal brewing to understand the advantages and review, brewing to understand its shortcomings.

1.Brew normally. 
Different teas have different brewing methods, which will not be specified here. The aroma of tea soup, tea soup thickness, smoothness, aftertaste  to feel the characteristics of tea. Tea shop owner need to choose teas for different tea lovers. Therefore, if you can provide as rich flavor as possible under the condition of the minimum SKU, you can meet the preferences of more tea lovers and thus gain more customers.

2.Review brewing.
The necessary methods for professionals to judge the quality of tea. If the tea merchant does not have a professional evaluation cup, the appropriate extension of steeping time can be used to grab the shortcomings. 

Tea at any price  should not be a problem one. A problem tea is one that has an unusual aroma or taste.

But in fact, the definition of abnormality is very difficult to standardize, and there are sometimes statements in the market that a high carbon fire smell is chocolate or a musty smell is plum. Personally, I think the only criterion is whether you feel comfortable physically, regardless of whether it tastes like chocolate or plum. If the tea makes you uncomfortable, even if it really has such a flavor, you don't need to endure to taste it.",1611213143

tea,ablecha,l6w551,Does new white tea have green taste ? Will the white tea with green flavor be transformed into high-quality old white tea after long-term storage?,"It is normal for new white tea to have a little green taste within one or two months after it is put on the market. However, when new white tea still has fishy green taste after half a year, it belongs to improper processing.

If you're hoping to turn green white tea into well-tasting old white tea over a long period of time, you'll be disappointed. 

Green flavor in the flavor of the performance of the plant herbal aroma and taste green astringent. 

From the technical analysis: 
1.grass aroma is a low boiling point of aromatic substances, withering time is not enough, the low boiling point of aromatic substances will be retained. 
2.Taste green and astringent, but also because of the withering time is not enough.

Simply put, insufficient withering time, insufficient binding and conversion of amino acids, polyphenols, and various other substances, will not result in an optimal combination of inclusions. 

So will the changes that occur during withering continue to occur after long periods of storage? The answer is no.

1.White tea has been dried when it is stored, which is different from the condition in which water is retained when the tea is withering. 

2.When white tea is stored, the external environment is also different from that of withering when it is in the sun. 

With such a different internal and external environment, how can storage accomplish the transformation that should take place during withering?",1611839297

Twinings makes some of my favorite teas including today's Darjeeling and Darjeeling Origins blends. I inherited my taste for Twinings from my mother who's love for the brand is only surpassed by her love for the now no-longer-produced Twinings Green and Black tea. Anyways, I thought it would be an interesting change of pace to compare these two blends directly against one another. Both will be brewed with the same water at the same temp for the same length of time and I'll try them side by side.

Daily Tea #8

Darjeeling Tea, Twinings of London, Black Tea:

Temp: 100c / 212 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 5 min

This tea is one of my staples which I've had hundreds if not thousands of times over the years, so I thought it would make a good choice to help calibrate my reviews and to set a bench mark for what types of teas I like and what score out of ten I would rate something I drink on the regular. While the Darjeeling blend isn't my favorite Twining's blend (we'll see some others later) it has a solid and consistent profile that I can count on 9/10 to deliver an excellent cup of tea.           

If brewed for the correct amount of time -which is critical for most Darjeeling's as the quickly turn bitter- this blend finds a nice balance between the dry, grainy character and the smooth and sweet notes common to Darjeeling tea. This combination of textures and tastes creates a more multi-dimensional profile which holds itself up better to improper brewing while also allowing for the selection of a specific flavour profile depending on the brewing time.     

Both simple enough to drink for a nice pick me up, and complex enough for a sit down to properly enjoy the flavours, this tea really can offer a lot to both the casual drinker and to the more advance palette. While Darjeeling isn't my particular favorite, it's a solid choice for any situation and a blend I recommend to anyone. We shall see if I still hold this blend is such high esteem after 91 more days of tea review but for now this rates a solid score.     

Rating, hot: 7/10           with sugar: 8/10

Daily Tea #9

Origins Darjeeling Tea, Twinings of London, Black Tea:

Temp: 100c / 212 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 5 min

When I sat down to brew both of these teas I expected to have very little to say about the differences between the two of them, after all both of these blends are Darjeeling mixes made by the same company from (presumably) the same tea producers. However, when comparing the Origins Darjeeling to it's standard sibling I found it highlighting my least favorite qualities about Twining's Darjeeling tea. The Very same thing that limits the Darjeeling blend to the lesser ranks of the Twining's catalogue work against this blend. Despite the identical brewing conditions I found the Origins tea to be more brash and rough, bitter and dry. Rather then being refreshed after drinking the pot I just found myself thirst and unsatisfied. Somehow this tea had both an (admittedly very) faint metallic taste (almost like licking a door handle) and a strong woody, almost twiggy, aftertaste which reminds me of the time that I ate a bunch of ash leaves when I was little.     

While I am over magnifying the poor qualities of this tea to make the comparison more clear between this brew and the standard Twinings Darjeeling, I did not particularly enjoy this lesser-middling tea. If you're going to try some yourself I recommend that either you go for a quicker brew at a lower temperature to lessen the astringency or add a good measure of sugar which I found to not only lessen the bitterness, but also to elevate the aforementioned twiggyness into an interesting, if a bit unusual flavour. I'll have to take another go at this blend sometime to see if I just brewed it wrong or had a bad batch but considering that this cost me about 50% more per bag then the standard Twinings Darjeeling, I'm not anxious to buy another box.

I'm thinking something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G3L1KF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_XmCeGb325PS0Z?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1


I was originally looking into getting one of those over the cup steepers, here's the link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FPN8TK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_0kCeGbTAJF2PP
I just don't like using any type of plastic as it stains and is harder to clean. So, I always prefer glass or ceramic for cleaning and it's why the French press appeals to me. 


What's your opinion on using a French press solely for brewing tea? Any pros and cons you can see? Only con I see is over steeping, but I always portion out only what I'm able to drink in one sitting. 

Thanks in advance for your replies!",1611777191
tea,shaidyn,l6ci9b,Embarking on a journey to make my own chai tea blend,"Hey, folks! After many years of drinking chai, I've decided to make my own blend. This is because every time I fall in love with a blend, they stop making it. I mourn the passing of yogi chai black!

I'm curious, though: How finely should I chop ingredients? Things like lavender and cloves and cinnamon? In bagged teas it's usually pretty fine, but is that the best way to go about it? Are whole cloves a good idea, or is that going to be too strong? Or, will chopping it up finer actually make the flavour that much more forward?

tea,Detective-Expensive,l5a2rp,Could someone help me find this pu'er tea or something really similar?,"Hi. (Spoiler alert) This is a tragic story with an even worse ending.

In 2014 I had the opportunity to go to Beijing. Back then I did not know much about teas, my communication skills were nonexistent, and it was my first time outside Europe. I've asked my guide to help me buy some good tea while we were on the Wangfujing street. 

In the shop I saw some nice round pu'er cakes, so I decided to buy 3 (first mistake).

I really liked the tea. It had deep woody, earthy flavor accompanied by raisin, orange, brandy notes. Slightly sour, but became sweeter with every steeping.

Now we are in 2021, I have no cake left (yes, I loved them so much that I only brewed from the cakes a few times and far in between). 

My understanding of the language is still as bad as in 2014, although now I have the resolve to learn. The google/Bing searches did not give any usable results, and the teas that I've tasted so far did not come close to the taste of those cakes.

So here I ask you, people of Reddit, to please help a fellow teahead if you can by finding the tea (I've added an image), or recommend one which you would think is up to the task.

A bit of informative history - I am deeply into matcha and love the flavor profiles of most matchas that I've tried, and my wife enjoys some of the single-origin senchas from Sazen. I also quite like some of the more umami flavors from sencha that are present in matcha as well. We both like espresso - I've become a bit of a home barista over the past year - and we both tend to like a medium to dark roast for espresso; I like cocoa and fruity flavors in mine, and she tends to appreciate sweet and fruity notes. We both like chai (lightly sweetened, with or without milk) for non-Japanese tea. Of the Chinese teas that we've tried thus far, she has not cared for the floral notes in a Jasmine green or the Honey Orchid style of Dan Cong.

With all of that said, what are some recommendations from you fine folks for teas that might be worth trying? I'm primarily interested in sticking to oolongs, sencha, and Chinese greens, but would entertain pretty much any suggestion for loose leaf; however, I'm not interested in making the dive into pu erh quite yet.

Oh, and worth noting - as it stands, I tend to order on a pretty regular basis from Sazen, Yunnan Sourcing, and Hibiki-an, so something from one of them would be a bonus for ease of accessibility.

[Mei Leaf Ya Shi Dan Cong \(Duck Sh\*t\) Oolong](https://preview.redd.it/4lhw97pwvb561.jpg?width=2700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940e9d811d9be71e8397861d90f797ed17e2036f)

This was my first dan cong ever. I expected some beautiful and intense fragrance but it's just bad. I had the highest expectations for this tea as it is **$1.11/g** \- used 6g in this 100ml gaiwan = $6.66 which is really expensive, nowhere near the other expensive tea I've got in the last 4 orders. I've got Mi Lan Xiang Dan Cong from What-Cha for $0.33/g and I haven't tried it yet, but it's more than 3 times cheaper and I bet, I hope that it will be better than this. This is the worst oolong I've ever tried while expecting to be the best. Did they mess up the packaging and gave me something else? It's from March 2020, the leaves are extremely dry and light and don't have any smell while dry and almost nothing while wet. It's also bitter, but the tea has almost no smell at all. I'm very confused. For some reason it got more fragrant at the 3rd infusion and the fragrance went away again at the 5th infusion. I used 99C hot water, 10 infusions 6g from the tea in 100ml gaiwan. Probably brewing it wrong, but I followed their instructions. I mean... it's not a bad tea... nevermind, it is. It's incredibly dry and slightly bitter and it has some vague floral notes, but it's very flat or I'm just bad at tasting and expected too much from it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry for the rant, I'm just confused. Can you explain what does ""dan cong"" actually mean? Is it just leaves from older trees in the Guangdong area? I bet it is not really from a single tree, but probably just older one? If it's from older trees, then it is normal to be more bitter and astringent I guess. I'm probably just dumb and very uneducated and don't know what to expect from a dan cong. Sorry. Can you recommend me good online vendors for dan cong? I want to explore more dan congs, aged whites and aged raw pu'erhs in 2021. This is my tea goal for 2021",1608030639

I've been using this for a week now. It can be in either Celsius or Fahrenheit (if you're having a hard time figuring out how to switch it from the manual, its just press and hold both the plus and minus buttons, took me a few tries to get it to switch). It goes up and down by 10 degrees f at a time or 5 c (I think, I don't use c). The most amazing part is that the tea I make from it tastes so much purer then any other kettle I've used before. So much purer in fact that I actually had to use more tea then I have before to be satisfied because it felt like it was so pure it was weak. Of course it is possible that me feeling like the tea was too weak is my own taste changing. But the water is far purer then other kettles I've had. It stays hot longer because of the insulation, even if you don't use the keep warm setting the kettle itself can keep it warm just by insulation. when not pressing the button to poor water its water tight. It heats up pretty quietly, and beeps pretty quitely as well. It is a little bit heavy because of the insulation but I don't think its unreasonably so. In real life it looks black unless you have the light hit it right, then you can tell that its actually a dark purple. It looks really good. It does have a bit of a short cord, but usually that shouldn't be much of an issue as places you'd usually place it shouldn't be that far from a outlet, its a bit over 2 feet of cord, which it has a spot on the underneath of the heating plate to wind it back up in. It has a button labeled rapid boil, if you ever just need some boiling water (assumably for something other then tea). it also seems to remember the last temp you used, for example I use 195 f for my black tea, I just press the + button and it immediately sets itself up to that temperature.

This was my first tea order in my life after someone here suggested me What-Cha 6 weeks ago. Meanwhile I ordered twice from MeiLeaf and once from Taiwanese Tea Crafts (after I fell in love with the Taiwanese ones I tried from MeiLeaf). What a journey! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my \*very strange\* experience - I feel like sharing what happened with you. It has happy ending :)

 Three people here told me that What-Cha orders arrive in a week and I was so sad that nobody contacts me from the local postal services. I received my other orders via DHL and UPS but with my last MeiLeaf order (free shipment from the Black Friday) arrived in the local post office and they put a message in my post box (what's the word in English? it's not my native language). It was soggy and almost ripped in parts almost disintegrated - I dried it and went with it to the local post office and... The lady there told me that I have a package for half of month sitting there and that it's scheduled for ""destroying"" in 5 days - my What-Cha package for over $100 that I was waiting for 34 days. But I knew that our local postal services are terrible and they don't even call us instead they come to the address, put a message somewhere instead of delivering directly the package. Anyway, I will know next time to visit the post office every 5 days, lol (I live near it, but I work from home and I became so lazy that I don't want to move my butt 100m away from home and imagine how lazy they are to destroy something that they can come and ring to my doorbell 100m away from them). End of story. Happy ending :)

This is my first Chinese tea ever. Embarrasing I know. I quickly fell in love in the last 30 days with the Taiwanese blacks and oolongs because they are so gentle, not bitter, not astringent and incredibly fragrant, so I almost thought that the Chinese would be ""worse"". Oh no no no. Big mistake, stooooopid brain of mine. This is absolutely amazing. Yes, it's very very very strong. It's also a little bitter but not astringent. And since I started using a gaiwan (stopped calling it gong fu, because someone called me out here that I should not call it gong fu brewing) and quit the sugar and almond milk (30 days ago) I knew that I couldn't drink any bitter teas without sugar. Again huge mistake. This is not too bitter, not like Indian teas, it's very gentle bitterness and it went away after the 5th infusion. I immediately thought about 60% chocolate, it's the most chocolatey tea I've tried. And it's not some vague note that I ""feel"" like trying to distinguish notes in other teas - it's clearly chocolate. You can't think of anything else. If I didn't know that it's a black tea, I would've guessed that this is a cacao shells infusion - the bitterness is exactly like a 60-65% darker but not very dark chocolate and the smell is exactly like cacao. It's perfect for cold winter mornings. Definitely the best black tea I've ever tried. I said the same tea a week ago about the Taiwanese Shanlinxi Qing Xin Black from Taiwanese Tea Crafts, but this Yunnan is bolder, stronger with simple but delicious smell and the slight bitterness wakes me up even faster, lol. I'd drink this as an everyday tea instead of the Shanlinxi - which is also incredible, but too gentle for early mornings.

&amp;#x200B;

What-Cha totally lived up to my high expectations and it deserves all the praise it receives and even more.

Tea, the most well-liked beverage consumed by two-thirds of the world‚Äôs inhabitants is comprised of the processed leaf of Camellia sinensis. Tea sorts, primarily based on processing or harvested leaf growth are black (fermented), inexperienced (non-fermented) and oolong (semi-fermented). These main tea sorts differ in how tea is produced and processed in keeping with the totally different processes of drying and fermentation that decide its chemical composition. Inexperienced tea is produced through the use of younger tea leaves and offered for consumption without fermentation after withering, steaming or pan firing, drying and grading.

Black tea incorporates primarily thearubigins, theaflavins, flavonols and catechins. The overall polyphenol content material of inexperienced and black teas is analogous, however with several types of flavonoids current as a result of the diploma of oxidation throughout the processing

So i started drinking tea a couple days ago, and ive been watching mei leaf on youtube... he talked about being ""ea drunk"" in one of his video's, and said its a nice feeling and you get the best effects from the tea when you brew white, oolong, or green tea that has been aged gong-fu style, and that's the style i brew....

So i ordered and 8 year old aged white tea (quoted from source) "" cultivated in the 800 meters‚Äò mountain on Fujian province "" from china, and just some 2 year old jasmine tea....

So the first time i attempted to get tea drunk, i probably brewed about 5 grams maybe not even from these jasmine leave's and i drank 30+ cups (35ml gong fu tasting cups) and i felt alright... not really any different as om how he explained the effects to be, but i diddnt brew enough tea which makes sense... i just had a caffeine rush and felt genuinely good... Then after that i decided lets wait before i attempt this again, mainly because i diddnt want to feel like i was ""abusing the tea"" if there is such thing lol (i realize that sounds ridiculous, but now that i have felt a good ""tea drunk"" effect i understand it)

Now yesterday was interesting... i diddnt intend to get tea drunk but i just kind of did, and it was definitely an interesting experience and it was a stronger effect then i expected.... Basically i just really like tea, so since hte hour i woke up, til the hour when i went to bed, i diddnt stop drinking tea, other than when i went to the store to buy some tea lmao, but at night, when i finished probably my third or fourth liter (im not joking lol, i diddnt realize til i sat down and thought about how much i drank) of an aged white tea (with the odd pot of an 8 year old pu'ehr grown from the highest elevated tea treas in Taiwan and some milk oolong tea) i was just like damn.. things are kinda getting weird lol... 

i was super energetic probably from the caffeine but also very relaxed at the same time, and i couldn't really focus... i would get stuck on one thought that i couldn't stop thinking about (which is the same effect id get from smoking too much weed) or id just have no train of thought at all... id just feel as if the only thing's my brain could processes was what i was seeing but i also wasnt really impaired either despite this weird kind of psychedelic and subtle manic effect... and then as it started to die down a bit i just felt good... a little anxious but not really depressed lol, once it all finally weared off i had some shakes, i was very tired but in a relaxed sort of way and again pretty good...

So yeah that was my first experience from getting ""tea drunk"" and i was not expecting that at all, and i promise everything i felt was not placebo it was all genuine and i did not expect it at ALL to be so intense yet somehow subtle but i also cant wrap my head around how i diddnt really feel impaired at all at its peaks...

Anyone else ever get some insane effects off of tea? Id also like to point out that if your not brewing gong-fu or your not drinking aged tea (Preferably lighter teas) you may not have experienced this sort of effect if you were attempting to.. just throwing that out there because i read comments on other posts of people talking about how ""tea drunkenness"" is a myth and how they were never able to get this effect...

I don't mind going a little cheaper for flavored teas as I figure a bit of the teas' nuances will be lost anyway. I was however looking at the sidebar entry for somewhere for some higher quality plain teas.

The one in the number one spot seems to be out of stock of a lot but I bookmarked a few things.

I'm also looking at White2tea. I'm not one of those PC types or anything but kind of find a business questionable when they've got products named pussy and lumber slut. I know I'd never name any of my products something so unprofessional. I guess it's more original than ""dragon this"" and ""dragon that"" but honestly is kind of a turn off. Are they that good?

I'm decently stocked from RoT and have multiple pounds coming from Harney as well as over a dozen more types lined up to try from them so really now I'm aiming for something high grade that stands out from the crowd.

Being as batches change over the years and what was voted on in 2016 may not apply anymore, figured I'd ask here even though the sidebar list provided some clue.

Any specific recommendations for some high quality loose leaf black, green, white and oolong teas? Something you take a sip of and are just like ""damn that's some fine tea!"" to have here and there between the cheaper stuff or to kick the day off right.

Got the matcha covered from a specialized company, some cheaper plain teas and the flavored ones. Even some cheap bags for when I'm lazy. Just want to complete the collection now.",1611174768

This time around I bought and paid $2300 worth of Matcha, and specifically asked that they ship the package with ID and signature confirmation, so that no one else but the intended recipient could receive the package.

I also bought insurance for $60, in case something should go horribly wrong

They managed to send a $2300 package without ID and signature confirmation, the USPS guy left the package ""somewhere"" and marked it as delivered, although we never received it.

Eric Gower, the owner of Breakaway Matcha refused to send out a replacement, stating that the order is too large for them to replace it. This is despite me having paid them $60 for insurance.

The only thing I can do now is to warn others about using this company, as they are dishonest and irresponsible. 

At $209 per 30 gram matcha, they probably have a 400% markup on their prices in addition.

So they had more than enough room to do the right thing and re-imburse or send out a replacement, but they chose to screw over their customers  for some quick profit. 

Now they have my $2300, while I have no Matcha. All I can say is: keep away if you can.",1611158359

Secondly, I was wondering if it's necessary or beneficial to put Tokoname through the same boiling process as Yixing (with/without tea leaves) for the initial seasoning process.

Generally the teas are fine, and I like that they provide detailed information about brewing each tea on each package. But I feel the quality could be better, especially with Ti Kuan Yin, which I have drank before in Mexico and I remember it tasting better there.

Aromatic wood tone, a bit like cedar, and an interesting feel made it seem unique, along with a lot of honey sweetness, which tends to make the rest approachable.  Bitterness and astringency were moderate for a 2020 sheng (which varies by lots of factors).  For this tea type the question ""is it real?"" tends to come up, which I address a little in this.

tea,JordanOsr,l0a8l3,"""How much tap water do I have to add to get the right brewing temperature?""","I don't have a cool temperature controlled kettle so I sat down today to try and figure out exactly how much tap water I had to add to boiling water in order to get it to the right temperature for brewing specific teas. Starting with [this equation for the final temperature of two mixed liquids](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/mixing-fluids-temperature-mass-d_1785.html) I tried to reduce it down to an equation for the volume of tap water needed and thought it might be helpful to some people to share it. The equation should be

**x = (dV(100-dT)/(100-tT))**

Where:

* x is the volume of tap water required to add to the boiling water
* dV = Desired volume of water in the brewing vessel
* dT = Desired temperature of the final mixture
* tT = Temperature of water from your tap

This is done under the assumption that boiling water is 100 degrees Celcius, and you'll have to figure out how much boiling water to start with by calculating dV-x once you've solved the above equation for x. Just thought I'd post this product of boredom for anyone else who was curious about if controlling for temp can be done (Relatively) accurately at home without those temp controlled kettles.",1611023940

I'm doing a big end of the year project on the history and culture of tea and decided to try a variety for ""research"". Today I bought some ripe pu'erh tea for the first time. They are packed into little cakes. I followed the instructions and boiled 8 ounces of water to 212 degrees and placed the unwrapped cake  in a Pyrex glass to steep. When I poured the water over it the first thing that hit me was... the smell. It smelled like horse manure. 

Let me explain- it's not a ""bad smell"". I used to volunteer at a horse ranch and the smell of manure and hay is familiar to me. I actually quite like the scent, it is very earthy. It was just unexpected. I had my mom smell it and she agreed.

I strained the leaves and took a sip. It was very strong but had a nice flavor. I drank my first cup very quickly. Several things I noted were:

1. It made my throat feel a little weird. Tight, I guess. Like the feeling you get when you're trying not to cry.
2. It made me dizzy. Not too bad but just a little out of it. I looked up what this was and learned about Cha Zui. I'm wondering if this is was it might be

Pretty new to loose leaf teas. I have quit coffee about a month ago and started drinking loose leaf, which I fell in love with and am sort of obsessed about right now... 

This may be a bit of a silly question but I was wondering if it's the case that more expensive teas are better? I found a very well-regarded store near my city that sells many quality Chinese teas. I then placed an order for a bunch of their teas, mostly sample sizes to try and narrow down what I like. Then I then stumbled upon another store from a different city in my province that sells a lot of the same teas, and in general almost all of their teas, twice as cheap. Like 50g of tea in the second store costs as much as 25g in the first. It's quite disappointing, but at the same time I wonder if there's a reason behind that. Both stores have very good reputations, especially the more expensive one. Would that also mean that their teas are higher quality?

I recently moved from Germany to the UK. I used to oder green tea from this website [here](https://www.sunday.de/gruener-tee/).

As you can see they have an *extremely* large range of high quality teas. Hundreds of Japanese green teas alone. All with detailed descriptions of each tea and a nice ranking system. Normal everyday teas and luxury ones. They also have a large catalogue of really nice accessories (handmade ceramic tea ware and such).

I am looking for something of that level (for green tea) here in the UK as it is now really hard to get something from Sunday to the UK due to Brexit.

tea,wskv,kbz8nm,I think my boss is giving my baristas erroneous information about tea! Help!,"Hi r/tea,

I am the director of education for my small coffee company. I oversee about 8 employees and ensure that they meet all sorts of standards for coffee service and knowledge, like processing methods at the farm level and preparation in the cafe. 

My coffee company recently started sourcing its own teas, which is great because I love tea for all the same reasons that I love coffee. However, I wasn‚Äôt consulted before my boss distributed some educational material to my baristas, and a lot of the information therein seems to run contrary to what I‚Äôve learned about tea over my career working in specialty coffee.

We offer western style tea service. Everything is to-go due to COVID, so we put a tea bag in a 16oz cup and add hot water from our FETCO brewer that is probably between 195F and 205F. With that in mind, here are some of the issues I have with my boss‚Äôs educational material that I am looking for clarification on:

1. ‚ÄúWhite teas need a long steep time because it is the only tea that isn‚Äôt rolled during processing, which leaves the cell structures intact.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always treated white teas similarly to green teas. In past conversations with the owners of tea companies (like Song Tea out of San Francisco), it was generally suggested white teas benefit from lower temperature water and shorter steep times in the range of 2-3 minutes. 

2. ‚ÄúOolong tea leaves require water that is at or just below boiling.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always understood that oolongs greatly benefit from much lower temperature water.

3. ‚ÄúBlack teas made from spring picked buds benefit from a lower water temperature.‚Äù

This is the first time I‚Äôve heard about lower temperatures for black teas at all. I was under the assumption that there wasn‚Äôt really a distinction between brewing black teas that were harvested at different times of the year. 

Am I out of the loop a bit? Are my assumptions and prior experiences with western style tea brewing amiss?

I'll admit up front that I don't personally drink tea, but many of my closest friends do.

I found out that the company Adagio Teas allows users to make their own custom blends and group them together into fandoms, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The only problem is that I have no idea what different kinds of teas there are or what they taste like. If anybody here has any recommendations for the following ""theme ideas"" I would be very, very grateful to hear them.  


Film Reroll Blend - A mess of things that shouldn't work but actually turns out amazing.  


Peartree University Blend - A fictional college located on a small island off the main coast of Oregon. Despite the name, the school's crest is of a peach tree, so theoretically either fruit could work. It also has light supernatural elements; very Night Vale/Gravity Falls/Twin Peaks vibes, if that can be made into a flavor(?)  


Sweetplum Blend - One of the four houses of the University. Known for its students being artsy, dramatic, romantic, and willing to punch anybody that questions them on anything.   


Meadowbrush Blend - One of the four houses. Known for its students being earthy and outdoorsy.  


Okaroot Blend - One of the four houses. Known for its students being athletic and sporty. Unfortunately I don't have much more than this to go on.

This is the 2nd green oolong in my life - again from TTC. It's almost twice as cheap compared to the Longfengxia green oolong and I like it more. It's way more fragrant and I actually love these more floral notes. It has slight tiny bitter feel at the back of my throat but it's not something bad. 

I think that if I didn't know that this is a green oolong, I would've thought that it is a very good green tea. I'm not a fan of green tea, but this is really pleasant. Also it's my first ""baozhong"" whatever this means (Google says ""wrapped tea""), but I would buy this again. The floral notes are intense (my flower memory is not very good but probably lilac+jasmine?) and I enjoyed it for 5 infusions, then becames a little flat but I stopped at the 10th infusion (still fragrant, but watery in taste)

I think that the price is very reasonable ($0.32/g) for the awesome floral fragrance and nice light taste, probably cheaper because of the lower altitude, but it's still a Wild West to determine why one tea is expensive and other cheap. But this was a good surprise in terms of price and quality. I will try brewing it in 85-90C water next time but even if I can't remove the slight bitterness, it's still very good, one of my faves : 9/10! Definitely recommend it (lot 929)!

tea,sml930711,kagh26,my thoughts on tea and meditation,"I'm realizing that using tea to enhance meditation might not be the way, since the calmness from it is very temporary and I miss the point of mindfulness which is to **observe**, rather than cling to an experience.

Rather, it may be better for me to have tea drinking as the meditation itself. Like observing the sensory experience of heating the water, steeping the tea, pouring it into the cup, smelling the aroma, and carefully observing the taste. Not my idea, but something that has been around: ""Tea meditation""

""A tea meditation involves being mindful and present during all aspects of the tea ritual, including making the tea, drinking the tea, and being aware of the effects on your mind and body. ""  - from the link below

I've been making my best attempt at (unsweetened) milk tea for the last year with Positively Assam. It's strong, smooth, malty and affordable, but I'm curious about alternatives. In the past, I've enjoyed Red Blossom Tea Co.'s Formosa Red 18, but Taiwanese red/black blends appear to be too expensive for daily drinking. Murchie's Storm Watcher was not as complex as I had hoped. Years ago, I drank a range of Harney teas, including Milima, and have been looking at East Frisian as a possible candidate. Are there other excellent Assams/blends that folks would recommend for this purpose? (I'm in the US in terms of sourcing. I will probably try Smith's Portland Breakfast because it's regional, and peat and leather are two of my favorite fragrance notes.)

I am also wondering about process. At present, I boil the water, allow it to cool briefly, then steep a good four heaping teaspoons before adding (whole grass-fed) milk to the pan and straining. The resulting 2 cups are tasty, but I go through tea very quickly and have no idea if this is the best method.

(2 min steeping time for all Oolongs and 3 mins steeping time for all blacks),"I personally never brew tea at boiling point unless I'm drinking an herbal tea. I also brew my teas both Western and Gongfu style depending on my mood.  I just don't like the astringency, bitterness, and darker flavors that come out of the tea as a result of brewing at the 96-100¬∞C range. Based on my personal experience, even the heavily oxidized teas such as Da Hong Pao and Lapsang Souchong taste like they should when brewed at 90-95¬∞C. However, what I do notice is that the nutty, woody, and dark flavors take a backseat to the lighter, mellow, brighter, and floral flavors when brewed at 90-95¬∞C. When brewed at the 96-100¬∞C range, the tea becomes stronger and sometimes the flavor even leaves a really strong kick in the mouth.

As for steeping time, I usually stick to 2 mins for all Oolongs and 3 mins for all Black Teas when brewing western style.. For Gongfu style, I usually start with 15 secs and increase each interval by 5 secs. These time intervals seem to work perfectly for me.",1610473847

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a tea junkie since I was in primary school, for some reason I loved tea at such an early age, I guess I got that from my dad who really loves tea lol

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what brand of tea we used to use, but it was really good. This is just a guess, but maybe it could have been Clippers? I don't think I ever saw the teabag box, maybe once, my memory is really bad so I can't remember but it kind of looked like the Clippers box, so it could've been that, we bought all our groceries from tesco.

&amp;#x200B;

when we moved house a few years ago, we switched to Lidl because it was way cheaper to buy groceries there, my parents started to buy Knightsbridge Gold tea bags, at first I couldn't really taste a difference, didn't even know we switched tea bags, but recently they've started to taste really bad, I have no clue to why they do. I use sweetener (aspartame based tablets from tesco) to flavor my tea but I also used to use and still use sugar sometimes to flavour it, recently the tea has been tasting really strange, I can't explain it, it tastes so strange.

&amp;#x200B;

It is kind of an icky/heavy taste, but it doesn't taste that bad or ""icky"" in the normal sense, but if you drank more than a cup of this tea you'd feel sick, it's the flavor of this tea I think, but it's just strange since I think we bought this tea from the start of moving house, could be wrong though. Has anyone else tried this company, the Knightsbridge Gold teabags?

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to try out yorkshire gold teabags, bought it online and waiting for it to arrive, I hope it is better :D

&amp;#x200B;

also thoughts on aspartame in tea? I don't think the sweetener is affecting the tea too badly, as this has happened recently and I tried this same tea with brown sugar and it has the same weird taste/heaviness, it's hard to drink a cup of it, it's to do with the flavor/taste of it, or maybe it's just a changed appetite, who knows lol.",1610438771

tea,josqvin,kvjmg9,What Science Tells Us About Yellow Tea,"On the Puer forum I wrote the following article on Yellow tea (and how it compares in productions methods to Puer), and I am reproducing it here for all to see. 

This post is a summary of the following two scientific papers: 1) Xu, et. al., ""Yellow tea (Camellia sinensis L.), a promising Chinese tea: Processing, chemical constituents and health benefits,"" Food Research International 107 (2018), 567‚Äì577; and 2) Wei, et. al., ""The profile of dynamic changes in yellow tea quality and chemical composition during yellowing process,"" LWT - Food Science and Technology 139 (2021), 110792. 

Note that the main production steps of Yellow tea are withering--pan frying--""sealed yellowing""--drying. Sealed yellowing is where the tea is piled and covered with a cloth, or is wrapped tightly in paper. Certain types of yellow teas will include rolling before the yellowing or will have multiple steps of yellowing in between drying steps. 

Major points:

1) The kill-green step (""shaqing"") in which the tea is pan-fried in order to destroy endogenous polyphenol oxidase (PPO, the enzyme that causes oxidation) is performed to completion like in green teas (although it may be performed differently in some cases, i.e. longer at a lower temperature) and **unlike** in Puer in which some PPO will remain in the plant cells. 

2) The yellowing stage can be done in two different ways, ""wet"" and ""dry"" based on whether or not any drying has been done before the yellowing. Often yellow teas will include a short ""wet"" yellowing followed by baking and then by a much longer ""dry"" yellowing. Frequently the total amount of yellowing can approach 3 or 4 days, but performed in intervals. 

3) Oxidation is the primary chemical change that occurs during the yellowing stage. However, since there is no endogenous PPO left to perform that oxidation, the reaction requires an exogenous source of PPO. This is provided by a variety of microbial activity that thrives in the warm and wet yellowing environment.

4) Due to the microbial activity mentioned in #3, Yellow tea can be considered microbially fermented. This means that the yellowing processes is very similar in kind to the ""wet piling"" process used to make Shu Puer and other Heicha. The main difference of course is that for Shu puer, the process is done for a far longer period of time and water is added. Note that if the yellowing process is extended for a very long time, the tea will start to turn dark brown--showing again that oxidation is the key activity--albeit oxidation aided by exogenous microbes. Another interesting clue is that Yellow tea develops a high level of betaine after yellowing--exactly what happens to shu puer as well. 

5) For those concerned with health effects, Yellow tea has been shown to carry a similarly high level of polyphenols (catechins) as with Green tea, but with differing amounts of each catechin (More ECG and less ECGC in comparison to Green). Yellow tea has higher total catechins compared to white tea, which shows how much more oxidized white tea actually is, given that the latter does not undergo kill-green. Yellow tea has been shown to be extremely effective at promoting, liver, stomach, and cardiac health and has the highest levels of **L-theanine** of all six tea categories. 

Conclusion: I at first thought that Yellow tea could be considered similar to Sheng puer in production method. This was incorrect as Yellow tea is made with a complete kill-green phase. It is in fact more similar to Shu puer in that both are microbially fermented.",1610423241

3. White monkey green tea. Honey like after taste and just perfect really. I choose this over Dragonwell/long jing.

4. Any gyokuro. 

5. Sencha Oku kirishma. This is by far the most unique green tea i have tried. You can brew it at 60c to get Gyokuro like steep, or steep at 70c to get Fukamushi like soup texture with sweet pea like taste, or use 75c to 80c to get high quality sencha steep with balanced bitterness and umami.

But ussually that is no problem since they have cheap shipping. With UK orders ussually the shipping already hammers the price into above 22 euro's. 

If there is good places in the Netherlands I would like to know as well.

Thanks :)",1610717216

I went to a local shop called the lancaster spice exchange, looked around a little, asked some questions, and left, 4 different blends to try.

I had this blend, Mint-Chilla Chai-Nilla Tea, I followed instructions to the letter,

Steep 1 tablespoon in 8 oz of 212 degree water for 5 mins.

I tried to steep it longer, I tried adding more tea (went as far as adding 2 and 1/4 tablespoons of leaves to 8 oz) and the tea was really watered downed.

tea,Lolo_UK,kxhfdw,Loving this mug warmer. Good bye to cold tea,"After reading a lot of reviews and getting a lot of useful feedback from everyone.

I‚Äôve finally purchased the Cosori mug warmer (including mug), and I highly recommend it to all the tea drinkers out there that get easily distracted like me and end up with cold tea. 

I‚Äôve been using it for the last 3 days and I am pleasantly surprised how effective it is.

Anyone that‚Äôs used a hotpot machine or familiar with an induction hob can expect these mug warmers to get pretty hot. I‚Äôve had my cup on the provided stainless steel cup for like nearly 3hrs straight and it kept my tea perfectly warm at the desired temperature (70c for me) But can be adjusted  anywhere from min 25c to max 110c . It heats up pretty quickly. It just heats up even without anything placed on top.

Also be aware the heat does go through to the bottom of the device and I've noticed my desk getting slightly warm, so I've placed some heat proof mats just incase it damages my desk. 

As the provided cup is metal, if you kept it heated for too long it does make it too hot for the lip, so just need to be careful and turn it down abit if its scorching. 

I‚Äôve tried using my own ceramic mugs that is not flat base and it works. It can keep the tea warm but you really have to turn it up to make up for the heat its losing, if you have a lid it helps. 

Overall I highly recommend it.

It goes into basic flavor profiles, processing, oxidation level variation, and aging concerns just a little.  Part of the intro:

**White teas tend to be pleasant and interesting, approachable, not astringent at all, and either quite subtle or else possessing good sweetness and intensity, and floral and fruit flavor. Aged versions can pick up deeper dried fruit or warm spice flavors.**

**White tea is considered to be one of the main categories of teas. Those groupings also include black tea (also called red, based on a Chinese-language convention), green, oolong, dark (hei cha, with pu‚Äôer typically grouped as this type), and yellow (which can also be left off as a main type, for being more rare).**

**Processing steps determines these tea types, not other factors (plant type, region source, oxidation level, etc.)...**

I recently got a new tea pot and I'm having an issue where every time I re-steep my tea in the pot, it comes out bitter, and I'm not sure what's causing it. For years I've never had a tea pot, I've just steeped my tea in one cup and poured it through a strainer into another cup, and I've never had any issues with bitterness unless I accidentally made the water too hot or let it steep too long. I generally use about the same temperature and steeping time for re-steeps as I do for the first steep. When I use the tea pot, the first steep comes out perfect, but any subsequent steeps are bitter. I thought maybe the water wasn't all draining out after the first steep, but it doesn't look like there's any more water left than when I used my previous method. I even tried rinsing the leaves with cold water before steeping again, which seems like it helped a bit, but it was still bitter. Any idea what's going on??",1606935066

I'm mostly used to brewing green tea and light oolong teas so I'm still adjusting to black tea. They taste ok but not as strong as I hoped. Something is wrong when a Longjing has a stronger taste than a Jin Jun Mei. Or it could be the quality of the leaves. The black teas I bought weren't too expensive

Here are my brewing parameters: 

&amp;#x200B;

Loose-leaf to water ratio: 2g per 6oz. I've used this ratio for other teas such as Longing, Jasmine Tea, and Tieguanyin and it seems to work out very well. This is also falls within the recommended amount of leaves for western brewing (2-3g per 6-8oz)

Temperature: 90¬∞C. I don't like the dark tasting notes. I also have a low tolerance for astringency and bitterness in my tea

Steeping Time: 3 mins. I've read that black teas can be steeped for 3-5 mins. I usually don't mess around with steep time in order to avoid bitterness and astringency. I tend to play it safe by steeping it at the minimum recommended time. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you guys brew your black tea and what do you suggest I change in my style? And how do you know if the culprit of a poor tasting pot of tea is the quality of the leaves rather than the brewing parameters used?",1606926754

I bought 100g of a South Indian White Havukal from TeaGschwendner, and it was absolutely divine. I had drunken mostly black coffee and some english breakfasts I had no clue how to make, and my first real cup of a more delicate tea was just great. Months later, this tea now tastes just more uniform and doesn't evoke the same emotions within me. I've stopped drinking coffee altogether and I've noticed I can taste much more in my other teas, but this one just feels flat now. Even if I prepare it in the exact same way (which isn't how I prefer it anymore) it just isn't the same. Could it be that maybe it's because I'm closer to the bottom of the bag and there are more stems and twigs? Or just that my palate has refined some and this isn't nearly as nuanced as I originally thought? It's still good, and when I eyeball the amount of leaves (usually adding a bit more than recommended) it has a lot more of a richer quality and is much smoother, I just can't get it as good as how it once was. Is this normal? I don't have a lot of teas so could it just be overconsumption of this one tea?",1608202483

Tea, or ""infusions"" in general, have been a thing for literally thousands of years.  More plants than I can count (in addition to tea itself) are used as an infusion throughout all kinds of different cultures.

Similarly, tobacco has been used for at least hundreds (maybe thousands?) of years by many different cultures, in many different forms--pipes, cigars, nasal snuff, Swedish snus, American dip, etc.

How have the two never crossed?  We've been infusing all kinds of plants into hot water for thousands of years, and using tobacco in many different formats for almost as long.  Is there something inherent to tobacco which would make it unsuitable as an infusion?  Obviously just steeping some pipe tobacco or snus or whatever in hot water would be disgusting, but then again smoking snus or putting cigarette tobacco in your mouth would be equally gross--point being, tobacco is cultivated and cured for specific purposes.

tea,GamingNomad,kh2jvx,How do different grades of tea differ?,"
I mostly shop on YS, and sometimes it's confusing for me when I see multiple entries for the same tea, for example Mi Lan Xiang. 

Usually I just look at the price and assume the quality. This is now the 3rd time I've ordered Mi Lan Xiang. This batch seems much flatter. I mean it's still good, and it still feels like Mi Lan Xiang, but it isn't as fruity or floral. Sometimes I wonder if it's just my head and something about expectations. I remember the first time I tasted Mi Lan Xiang (first order of Chinese tea) and thinking ""I LOVE CHINESE TEA!""

tea,ProbablyNotPoisonous,kgok0s,Can't seem to find the sweet spot for oolongs,"My oolongs smell wonderful, but they either taste like nothing or get bitter.

I have five different oolongs from Song Tea. I'm using Absopure brand spring water to brew them. I've tried following the instructions for tea amount, time, and temp; short gaiwan steeping with lots of leaf; hotter water; cooler water; short steeps; long steeps; increasing steeping time; keeping steeping time the same over multiple steeps; using a teapot; using an IngenuiTea. Nothing seems to bring out any actual flavor except bitter, and then a faint sweet aftertaste.

I use a Cuisinart electric kettle to heat the water. The teas all have suggested brewing temps of 205 or 208 F, but the kettle has 200 and Boil settings with nothing in between. I've tried using the Boil setting and pouring the water into another container before pouring it over the leaves, and I've tried just using the 200 setting. I've also tried Boil straight from the kettle in the name of experimentation. Which setting I use doesn't seem to make nearly as much difference as steep time, but in any case my tea is either flavorless or bitter. None of the fruit/cocoa/molasses/whatever notes the package claims - although, like I said, they *smell* wonderful and distinct.

I thought maybe smell was actually all there was to it, and then I tried some wild tree purple tea from Yunnan Sourcing and was blown away by how it tasted (and posted here about it a short while back). Intense dark fruit, wood, and honey notes with an unreal sweet finish. So either there's a *drastic* difference between black and oolong, or else I'm brewing it wrong, somehow.

How do I figure this out?",1608442804

My idea while most defiantly terrible is to put a large amount say 6-10 maybe more teabags in one cup let it steep and then use this super concentrated concoction as a kind of quick way to make tea. I can heat up a mug of water pour in a small amount of my concentrated tea and I have tea quickly and easily with possibly a higher caffeine content skipping the whole steeping process(a process that takes no more than 5 minutes).

Initially I had a whole order on yuinns sourcing redy but with the shipping costing me over $200  I decided to try and find somewhere domestic in Canada to get everything. I was looking for a website that's a one stop shop, somewhere I could get aesthetically pleasing tea ware as well as quality tea.

I found way down in the side bar a Canadian shop https://treasuregreen.com they have all the tea ware selection I am looking for but it is pretty expensive, with some of it being insanely expensive. I'm not sure if they just stock really nice stuff or they charge to much. Now where I am truly lost is selecting tea from them, I have no idea what I'm looking for or what's quality and what's not. I mostly right now drink black tea, Earl Gray and chi. I basically want to try some quality black tea, green tea, oolong and pu-erh. I want to try all the main categories of tea and start developing and figuring out what I truly like.

Curious with regards to both tea bag brands and loose leaf varieties. I'm a coffee drinker too so I would like to reduce my caffeine intake. Actually, I drink tea and coffee both purely for flavors and prefer neither to have caffeine if given the choice, but for coffee this isn't really realistic without sacrificing quality.

Curious if anyone noticed the difference between decaffeinated tea and their unaltered counterparts in general. I realize the decaffeinating process does strip the tea some of its health benefits and inevitably affects the tea flavors at the chemistry-level but curious if anyone actually notices these nuisances in e.g. the versions of a tea bag brand where i assume the flavors are already ""brought down to a common denominator"" from the processing vs. loose leaf alternative.",1607183168

I took my first stab at growing camellia sinensis this year. I've encountered a few issues and was hoping you all could help me out. The plants were growing well throughout most of summer but sometime around mid-August yellow leaves began appearing along with brown spots on the healthy leaves. I have tried searching all over for the cause, but I can't find anything like what is happening to my plants. Once a brown spot appears, it spreads and the leaf eventually falls off. New, healthy leaves are still growing while this is happening. 

The plants are potted in miracle grow fast draining soil with just a bit of Dr. Earth acid loves mixed in. I have not fertilized or added anything since they were planted in spring. To help with soil draining I added some stones in the bottom of the pot prior to putting the soil in. I water them about once a week, making sure the soil is somewhat dry before watering again. They were outside all summer, but I have brought them inside recently for winter. The problems started prior to bringing them inside.

My father in law ordered some because he remembered drinking it in his youth once or twice. He wanted me to try it but after smelling it I refused adamantly. He continued to try to get me to have a cup  over the next few visits (he admitted that he hated the taste himself) and when I finally agreed to try it his eyes lit up anticipating my horror and digust. 

Much to his chagrin  I loved it. Smoky, peaty, sweet and warm. It was heaven in a glass and I have not looked back. Every morning since ( he unloaded all his tea on me)  I have drank a cup of lapsang souchong to start my day and I am losing enthusiasm for coffee.

However, my asthma has been acting up and I can't figure out why. Suddenly it hit me that perhaps the lapsang souchong was culprit. Although I think my asthma has been acting up a little before my first cup.

I desperately want this not to be the case, because I am in love with this tea. I have even ordered more varieties off the internet. 

A quick Google didn't bring anything up and I don't have a doctors appointment until Thursday , so I am putting it out to r/tea hoping that there are some lapsang souchong lovers with antecedotal evidence on the subject or a tea expert who can enlighten me.

I've been drinking Lapsang souchong for many years.

The last few years I've noticed that different Lapsang from different shops can vary a lot.

I like them real tarry/smoky, but some Lapsang mostly resembles plain black tea(!!)

I am sure there's variety with different blends/brands and that's fine, but I haven't had a really satisfactory cup of ""bog water"" for years and that's *not* fine! =-(

Even my last order I had from the shop that used to serve me real good lapsang was dissappointing.

Is this because:

1. I am less sensitive to the smoky quality of the tea?
2. It could be a different brand or just older tea (because it's a small local shop)?

I really hope it's not option 1! =-D  

I doubt you can answer that, but can you answering me on:  


Is lapsang suspectible to long or bad storage? I am inclined to assume the smoky aroma is volatile.

  
If I want to find the smokiest/tarriest Lapsang, I have to try international tea shops, right? (tea bought locally in my small country can be old).  
I've avoided buying from international shops as transport fees to Norway can be really expensive. It might be something I'll have to try, though, and maybe try 2+ different brands simultanously, as side-by-side comparison may be the best way to compare brands. 

Is lapsang in satchets (""bags"") fine, or should it be loose tea in an air tight box?  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

tea,bigballsblues,k6ku1j,Just ordered my first brick of Sheng Pu-Erh and Ive got some questions,"The past few months I've been browsing the internet, primarily looking at teas and incenses. Just a little while ago I was looking around on the Harney and Sons website, as I was ordering a new tin of CTC Assam (one of my favorites) and I came across a tea called something along the lines of 2007 Sheng Pu-Erh, something I hadnt ever heard of before. It seemed interesting so i clicked on it. And then the image came up and I realized that, it was a tea i had before, and I remember absolutely loving it. So at this point I knew i had to get some.

After some research I figured out that what I probably had unknowingly been drinking was an aged variety of Pu-Erh, so I began looking at those. 

I found a 1.5oz brick of Mid-90s Pu-Erh on Livingteas, I read the description and it just felt right as to what i was trying for. So after some careful deliberation between a few different vendors and teas I went with that one. 

Now, my questions are as follows

I was more than likely brewing the tea I had a few years ago quite wrong (Full boiling water, 4-6 min steep time)
What can I do to make my experience with it better this time around?

How long should a brick of this size last? 

How should I store it? 
I remember the previous brick I had began to get *extremely* dry and brittle after about a month of having it. If you are wondering how I acquired it without knowing it was Pu-Erh, I was at a friends house whilst having tea and they mentioned they had a ""brick"" of tea they wanted me to try (which confused me at the time, i didnt know tea could come in a brick), which was the Pu-Erh, after I had tried it I told them that I very much enjoyed it and they took about a 0.5oz piece off of what they had (would estimate around 2.5 oz is the size they had). I had just had it stored in a ziploc bag in a cupboard.

tea,philantrophe,kjvjbl,[HELP PLEASE] Matcha only tastes amazing in ice cream.,"Matcha has always been one of my favorite ice cream flavors. As in skid the ice cream with the side of a spoon enough to barely coat the brim and savor every last bite good. Matcha tea on the other hand is an entirely different story. 

I had recently acquired ceremonial grade matcha and was excited to try it. A pleasantly sweet aroma echoed into the air as the tin was opened. I followed tutorials online to make sure it was prepared correctly. (water temperature, whisking motions, sifting the powder etc.) A fluorescent green foamy drink sat in front of me and I was eager to try it.  Yet I ended up being disappointed on how the taste came out. It was just bitter water. A different kind of bitter from premium/culinary grade matcha but it wasn't as satisfying as I would like. The experience reminded of coffee(another flavour that only tastes good in ice cream). Just a different iteration of bitter water. I don't think it was the milk or sugar that makes matcha in ice cream delicious as trying matcha tea with those doesn't yield favourable results.

So I'm currently wondering: Is the temperature of ice cream the deciding factor that allows me to enjoy matcha? Can I not enjoy matcha unless it's cold enough to omit the unpleasant flavors? And how exactly does temperature impact the taste of matcha?

The change in variance of flavour from tradiational matcha to matcha ice cream has left me feeling conflicted. Does this make me a ""fake fan"" of matcha as I don't like it served in its traditional form?

Jin Jun Mei

9/10 - 12 infusions

This is the real thing. Rose water, chocolate, lightly fruity, and a hint of honeysuckle. early infusions are marked by chocolate with infusions 5-9 being distinctly woody. the later infusions become sweeter with the honeysuckle shining through. I stopped at 12 infusions but it could probably go 2 more. this tea also surprisingly mellow for Jin Jun Mei, I felt very relaxed much like being in a very soft beanbag? I think that is how I would describe the feel of the tea. very luxurious beanbag while snacking on chocolates.

&amp;#x200B;

Fei Zi Xiao(Smile of Princess)

8.5/10 - 12 infusions

Reminds me of glacier melt I had in the Canadian Rockies. Crisp, rocky, and cooling(not like dancong cooling though). It has a very incorporated water taste which gives it a very unique character and permeates all of the steeps while different aspects of litchi come and go. This is a lot like I would guess an unsmoked lapsang souchong would taste if I had only had the smoked version. litchi is the primary flavor of the tea but it changes from more of an aroma to a more tangible taste the more you dig into the tea. I would like to note that this tea is not very sweet at the start but the aftertaste does have a distinct sweetness.

&amp;#x200B;

Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong

9.5/10 - 15 infusions

everything you want from a Lapsang Souchong and more. Classic smokey flavor with dried longans with added hot-chocolate; I would have expected to like this combination at a glance but it works so well. Perfect for snow-days and keeps you feeling warm for hours with a subtle lingering sweetness. I wish I could say more but smoked Lapsang Souchong tends to be a two note tea and this one has a wonderful 3rd note that puts it above the norm. I ended up trying brews 15-18 and they still had flavor but were lacking enough that I would say 15 infusions is a good place to stop judging the tea.

&amp;#x200B;

Aged Fir Narcissus

7.5/10 - 10 infusions

When I opened the sample and smelled it, I said ""that's definitely Jin Jun Mei."" This tea shares a lot of those characteristics such as the long sweet aftertaste and chocolate and floral notes but is distinctly different. It is a lot earthier overall while Jin Jun Mei is more light and floral. There is a nice cinnamon note in the first couple infusions and a marzipan note later on. I also picked up a consistent lemon flavor throughout the tea but it was really hard for me to place until I smelled the leaves once I was done with all infusions, because there is no sour or acidic flavor to this tea the lemon was surprising. Overall a solid tea but it lacked solidity in the flavor notes that the other teas possessed. For example, while I could definitely taste marzipan on brews 7-9 it never really held together between sips and left me wanting more but never delivering. Very unique flavors and definitely a tea worth trying if you are interesting in getting into Jin Jun Mei but prefer earthier flavors over the lighter floral ones that the traditional Jin Jun Mei offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Shui Di Xiang

7.5/10 - 12 infusions

This tea was described as ""unique water fragrance"" but I would classify it more as litchi, blackberry, huckleberry. This tea is solidly fruity, a lot of teas are described as such while having light notes of fruit but this one the fruit is out and on display. The background notes are chocolatey and earthy with a small amount of burnt caramel that comes out more in later infusions. these combination of background notes bring a smooth body to the tea while the fruity and tart notes up front keep your mouth watery; a very interesting combination that I enjoyed. unfortunately the tea did not offer much in terms of lasting flavors as they dissipated within a few minutes of drinking. side note: this is the first tea out of the 5 that had a twig in it, the rest have been purely leaf and/or bud. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts so far: fantastic teas. I have not sampled a place before that has had this level of consistency in teas. I will definitely be picking up some of the Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong as this tea really stood out. I got a couple more samples of Jin Jun Mei from other sources coming in so I will wait to try those. Only real downside to this place that I have seen in the first half is that they only offer black teas so its not a place I can solely get my teas from.",1608857049

After more than 3 weeks in this whole new world to me and 40 different samples of tea, I can call myself a teahead baby. Thanks again to everyone who helped me in the last 30 days with tips, suggestions, etc.

I tried 3 or 4 Taiwanese cultivars and I think I have my favorite - Qing Xin. In all of the Qing Xin oolongs and even one Qing Xin black tea from Shanlinxi I feel some really nice syrupy sweetness with fresh resin notes, which I absolutely love. I ditched sugar and any additives because of this sweet fragrance, I can almost feel the sweetness on my tongue. I never knew that there are so fragrant teas in the world. I'm glad that a bunch of people here suggested me to try some Taiwanese tea. Thank you all.

This oolong on the picture is my first high mountain oolong (the only high mountain tea was the Shanlinxi black) I had, but more importantly it is the first green oolong I tried from the samples. And I will be honest - it's not my favourite, even though it's one of the most expensive teas I currently have  (probably top3 with price $0.52/g). I'm definitely not disappointed, but I prefer the cheaper low altitude summer bug bitten teas to this. I probably sound blasphemous, but I feel it that way: more oxidised = warmer and sweeter (idk if it's always true). It's too green for me and it is very ""strong"" if that makes any sense for such light-colored liquor - I can feel very slight and almost non-existent bitterness with a little dryness after the 4th infusion. It is good though - the resin + honey smell is there, even though it's less fragrant it is much more complex than what I've tried before, and while I was drinking it I was thinking of oil? Could a tea be called oily? This doesn't sound right, but if you've tried a thicker vinegar it has the same ""oiliness"". As for the fragrance I can feel more green notes like steamed spinach and this time some pine needles, rosmary needles... this kind of freshness (I find pine needles similar to resin for some reason). Anyway, my imagination is too wild as my main hobby is cooking so I relate everything to food for some reason. Anyway, It's very good, I enjoyed it a lot and it remained strong, aromatic and tasty for 12 infusions, really long lasting tea and overall I can give it 8/10, but I will probably not buy it again as it's expensive. But I will look for more oxidised versions of this Longfengxia Qing Xin for sure.

Have you ever tried this one? I didn't find much info for it. I think that it's not that famous, but I'm glad I tried it. As always I'm open to suggestions for other green oolongs to try because now I'm intrigued even though I prefer the darker ones. Are there any baked/roasted green oolongs or when you bake it, it's no longer green? Probably silly question, sorry :D I'm still learning the different teas and how they are made. The description of this particular green oolong says ""baking level: none"". How is it so green then (you know enzymes and things like this)? Steamed? So there should be baked green oolongs just like the roasted green teas! Anyways, I will stop thinking ""out loud"" and I will wait for someone more knowledgeable than me to explain.

I've tested negative for COVID-19, and my doctor is confident it will go away with time. I would like to alleviate the cough as much as possible before I start to feel better, and tea is something my friends have suggested. 

The problem: I've hated tea my entire 28 years. I'm a generally annoying, picky person when it comes to drinks, but I would love to be a Tea Person. Even if I didn't have this cough, I still want to love tea. 

I'm so boring. I generally only drink water and Pink Drinks or Hot Mochas from Starbucks. I don't like intense flavors most of the time. I don't like my stepmom's iced sun tea, or the hot chai tea and iced black tea my friends have offered me. I definitely need sweetness, but trying a southern iced black tea from my friend was like drinking liquid sugar. 

Flavor likes: Strawberry, honey, lemon, mint, chocolate, walnut, hazelnut
Flavor dislikes: Intense flavors, flavors that feel like I'm drinking a lawn, Starbucks chai
* I would prefer hot teas, and for some reason a creamier (more coffee-like) thickness appeals to me

I know just trying different ones will help me lead to a tea I fall in love with, but I'm hung up on being worried I'll waste tea if I don't end up liking it. I hate wasting food or drinks, and I don't want to let my friends down with my pickiness.

I bought myself a mint chocolate tea last holiday season. It is the first and only tea I have ever bought for myself and if I put 3 spoons of milk and sugar in it... it's passable. But I still haven't finished even half the box which was probably only 20 or so tea... sachets(sp?). My only point being, I know literally nothing about tea (not even Arizonas, sweet or iced tea), so please go easy on me.

Regardless, I am trying to identify a tea to give as a gift to someone this holiday season. Earlier this year my friends and I went to Mitsuwa in New Jersey. For those who don't know Mitsuwa is a large Japanese supermarket with a food court and accompanying stores nearby. While I don't drink tea, I did go down the tea aisle with my friends and one of the things we noticed was a sign that had a simple graphic above the tea shelves explaining how caffeinated the various kinds of teas were. It listed a bunch between 1-5 stars (out of 5)... but then there was an outlier... One specific tea was listed at something like 11 out of 5. We eventually located the spot on the shelf for it, but it was sold out... So I don't even know what this looks like to give more information. I'd like to get this tea for one of my friends as a gift, even if it ends up being terrible tasting the memory of shopping together and this story will make a fine gift I think. If it comes down to it I'll just go there again, but if I can save myself the \~1 hour drive each way, not to mention it being potentially sold out again that would be awesome.

I've been following the instructions on how to make both teas precious so i don't think that's the issue but anyone can be wrong. To summarize I like the taste of both teas, i just wish it was stronger.

tea,Zycrus,kuehaf,Bancha Goishicha from What-Cha,"Japan is mostly famous for their green teas. So I was intrigued when i found out that there is more than green tea from japan has to offer. I looked for some time to get my hand on some Goishicha, which is a japanese Heicha made from bancha leaves. It goes through two fermentation processes and is pressed and cut into small square bricks.

https://preview.redd.it/87tjwgy9xha61.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6952622ab3265805631701e585e6f682b479e2bc

This tea is quite rare, even in japan. So rare, that for some time only one producer was left until the local goverment stepped in with support. So I was quite happy when I found this tea offered at the EU based vendor What-Cha. This way I could avoid problems with german customs. If somebody is interested in more details about the processing of this tea, you can check out this link: [https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha](https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha)

Upon opening the bag of this tea I was treated with a very strong and unfamiliar smell. It is very hard to discribe, because it is something completly different to other teas and tea types. It has strong fermented notes but coupled with a strong acidic tone to it. It is really unique and interesting but defnetly not something I would like to smell all day. For steeping I heated up my water to boiling temeperature an placed one brick in my 160ml Kyusu and rinsed the tea first. The wet leaves loose their strong smell a bit. The same notes are still there but turned down a bit and coupled with a little sweetness. For my first steep I started with five minutes as recomended by What-Cha

*Processing img dbkjb7mu2ia61...*

*Processing img jr0wxd0x2ia61...*

The color of the liquid is red- brownish orange a bit like amber and smells like the wet leaves but toned down.

The taste was quite a surprise, because it has a strong molass, licorice sweetness. Fermented notes like mushrooms are there but they are not so prominent as in other fermented teas like ripe Pu Erh. It also has a some acidity like a lemon based sourness. This acidity is there but it is not overwhelming the other tasting notes and it gives the tea and its sweetness an interresting kick. For my part I like the little sourness but I can imagine, that some people dont. So for my second infusion I agian brewed the tea with boiling water for five minutes but placed the liquid in the fridge for half an hour until it was cold. I read that this would nullify or heavily turn down the acidity of the tea and it worked. The cold tea kept its sweetness and fermented notes but lacked the acidity nearly completly.

So this is a very unique tea and definitely completly different to any other fermented teas I had in the past. I would definitely recomend to try out this style tea and enjoy it with loved ones for special occasions.",1610285402

tea,TheOnesLeftBehind,ktw6dx,"Her-cha review pt. 2, green oolong","Green oolong
First brew. No sugar.  
100ml Gaiwan and half the amount in the tin (I don‚Äôt have a scale. Sorry.)
Scent is orchid and jasmine like
Brew is a very light green and the scent is grassy
Fairly basic green tea taste. Thick feeling in the mouth. Flowery perfume lingers in the throat. Simple, but pleasant. Not buttery. Leaves have a scent of cut clover flowers

Second steep. 
Deeper green, about the same as the first steep otherwise. Leaves are still opening. 

Third steep + four pieces of rock sugar. Using approx 70ml from now on. 
Yet again little change, there is now a slightly toasted taste which is pleasant. 

Fourth steep + three more small sugars. Two minutes. 
More of a yellow color now. Floral scent is gone. Very sweet taste, not as thick and not buttery. The floral scent from earlier is in this steep even though it‚Äôs scent is gone. Not as toasted as the last until it cools some. Largely the same. I almost want it to have toasted rice in it. 

Fifth steep + 1 sugar
Three minutes
Not as pleasant. Feels thin and very one note. This one will go to my orchids. 

Sixth steep + 4 sugar 
Three and a half minutes 
Only has a bit of sweetness from the sugar. Not that pleasant either, though I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. The rest of this is for orchids.",1610216351

Firstly, I encountered a tragedy a few days ago: my Hagi yaki teapot that my partner had gifted me less than a month ago was broken by him (in an accident). There was some luck, and the teapot wasn't damaged that much, it was only the knob on the lid that got broke off. I think it's possible to glue it quite smoothly, but here's where I'm asking your advice. Does anyone know which sort of glue should I go for? Obviously something that is good for ceramics, but what I'm contemplating is the temperature that the glue can stand. So far I've found one that says it's good up to 65C. Maybe I am thinking this too much, but do you think it will be enough? The teapot is primarily used for brewing green tea so it's not like I'm pouring 100C water into it, but I guess the lid still gets a fair amount of heat especially in longer sessions. What do you think? 

If anyone has any stories about breaking precious teaware I could do with some peer support - it sucks that the thing that had to break was the newest, prettiest and most precious both in financial and emotional value.  

Naturally, after this accident I went to the internet to see if I could find a replacement. After some searching I found [this](https://www.tablinstore.info/) store that sells teapots similar to what I have. Do anyone of you have experience ordering from there? It looks reliable to me, but I'm still wondering if it's a trustworthy site selling the ""real deal"" so to speak. I don't know if it's pure madness to even think about getting another kyusu when the one I have will still be probably okay to use, but I grew fond of some of the pots on the site... 

Lastly, when reading about Hagi ware on Wikipedia I learned that its substance is porous and this means the colour of the pot will change in time. I had assumed that since it's glazed it's okay to use it for any tea, but does this mean that one pot should be dedicated to one tea type, as is the case with Yixing teapots? Should I also avoid washing it with soap? In the beginning I brewed some oolong with it and the leaves were left in the pot for some time and the smell stuck, so I washed it with detergent but after that I've only brewed green tea with it. Just wondering if I should keep it strictly green tea pot or is it okay to brew something else every once in a while. 

Thank you to anyone who can answer any of the questions! Hopefully you all have good day and some good tea to enjoy.",1610108252

well. this year isnt a good start for me. i have not only - in the past four weeks - destroyed the lid of my expensive yixing but also broke a teacup and the lid of my gaiwan.
im just a disaster.
thinking of new ways to bridge the way from my tea setup to the kitchen. gonna put it in a basket with pillows inside. so even if i drop the basket they should not shatter üò≠üò≠üò≠

anyways. since i only have half of a gaiwan and teapot left i thought it should be more common to trade half of teaware.
im sure some of you have broken a similar sized gaiwan and were left with the lid. but yeah sizes and forms differ i knooooow. could be measured ofc.

anyways. mostly just wanted to rant before figuring out where to get a new gaiwan. 

am i the only one this happens a lot to? how do you try to prevent it? and also. do you have a gaiwan lid for me? üòÇüò≠ (im sure the shipping is probably more expensive than buying a new one üòÇ)",1609976930

Also i like to make my chamomile solo and i make it intense because it calms me alot, 2 big cups a day, sometimes 3. In the afternoon ill have 2 and maybe 1 in the morning and play around betwen chamomile and lavendeer and st. jhons.

And linden tea from time to time again intense style.

I had no idea it would receive the response it did, and honestly it was just really cool for me to see something I created  be of such interest to people. My ‚Äúshop‚Äù is just my wife and me at home,  and last week we found ourselves making and shipping way more ounces of  tea than we ever imagined needing to make at such an early stage in  this venture (we‚Äôre just 3 weeks in!).

We had enough ingredients in the house to make a pound of tea, which normally would last a week, but last week that was not the case. The pound of tea went out to everyone in order, which covered most of you, but there were a few more orders to fill. I have a couple ingredients I cant get locally, and the short version is I hadn't been able to get one of them until today (I first reordered it last week using USPS 2 day, and that didn't make a difference. Then reordered it via Fedex Overnight on Monday, and it arrived this morning). So all remaining orders went  out today. I tried everything I could to get it here sooner but got overwhelmed with orders when I shared it here and it unfortunately  coincided with these unprecedented USPS delays, when at normal time it  would've been here in 2 days...

Being new to this, I've been really preoccupied with this over the last week, and given a couple people checked in with me today, I figured I would just share this situation with you all in case anyone else was  wondering.

Thank you so much to  those who have been understanding about the wait. It's the last thing I  wanted to happen, and I truly had no idea that post would generate more than a handful of inquiries.

So that said, I wanted to sincerely thank this sub for all the interest, upvotes, and thought provoking questions you all asked.

I usually make about 32oz batches at a time, using 1tsp per 6oz of leaves,  and drink it over the next hour or 2, I don't mind it getting cold at all.

Today I received the tin of Ummon that I ordered from Ippodo for a comparison, and I am blown away by the taste, the quality, and the difference in physiological response/energy that I get out of it.

With that said, I'm looking for a daily drinking matcha. I drink usucha with nothing added to it, usually two to three times per day. I've read other threads with recommendations, and I have some Aoarashi and Isuzu coming from Marukyu Koyamaen (courtesy of Sazen) to try, but I wanted to check here to see if there are any recommendations for a good daily drinker to keep on hand considering that I'm likely to go through about 60g every two weeks or so.

My current list of possibilities is as follows:

Aoarashi, Isuzu, Wako (Marukyu)

Kan no Shiro, Sayaka no Mukashi (Ippodo)

The Sayaka would be a bit of a budgetary stretch - I'm looking for that price point or lower - but I REALLY like the way that the Ummon is feeling in terms of energy and the taste was great, so that leads me to strongly consider Ippodo.

If you love tea in any other extent or fashion, e.g. as an occasional or maybe even everyday companion, but striving consistently for the most researched, authentic tasting experience is not your main concern, then please click away, this post is not meant for you: there are many other ways to obtain decent water for your brews, that are much more environmentally and practically sustainable, than buying expensive and hard-to-come-by, fine-tea-enhancing bottled water.*

\*\*\* RE-POSTING \*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

What water do you use with your special eastern teas? Do you avoid bottled water on principle?

If you do, the reason might be related with caring about the environment: I can relate with that. But when it comes to water and fine eastern tea, bad water kills the brew and my pleasure in drinking it, so I wonder: what is the point of looking for high quality, delicate leaves? That is a topic that puzzles me greatly, for the extent that its importance is underrated and casually disregarded among eastern tea enthusiasts and vendors alike.

Brewed tea is more than 99% water, and water interacts and bonds in a complex way with the tea compounds at a chemical level. It stands to logic that an essential part of the flavour of the final brew will depend on the quality of the water you used. For example, did you ever read anything about something called '***tea creaming***'? In short, it is a phenomenon that occurs when minerals in water aggregate the aromatic particles of tea into bigger molecules, that are not any more perceivable by our senses: in other words, water that is more mineral than let's say \~60 mg/l (a personal estimate based on years of experiments), not only it has a strong taste that may conceal, alter or cloud part of the goodness of tea, but it --literally-- **deprives the tea of its aromatic compounds** **(by precipitation)**, lowering *significantly* the number of ‚Äútasty‚Äù molecules that we can perceive. Does it make sense to you, buying carefully-made, highly expensive tea, to only perceive (and enjoy) half of its taste because of the wrong water?

But good water is so much more than the TDS value. It is a delicate balance between the individual quantities of the most important ions that influence flavour. In particular, calcium \[CA++\] (sweet, umami, earthy), magnesium \[MG++\] (bitter-sweet), sodium \[Na+\] (salty, bitter), potassium \[K+\] (sweet / salty, bitter), bicarbonates \[HCO3--\] (salty, alkaline, limy), sulphates \[SO4--\] (salty, rancid), chloride \[CL-\] (salty), silica \[SiO2\] (sweet).

Traditional water filters are not a good alternative medium to achieve tea-suitable water. They use two main mechanisms: ionic exchange and activated charcoal. Ionic exchange usually gives back two molecules of sodium for every calcium molecule it takes: that‚Äôs it. Involved ions may differ, but the idea is always the same: it is an *exchange*. Activated charcoal mostly filters organic compounds, not minerals. Both methods do very little to alter the balance of most of the other ions.

Inverted osmosis and other more advanced means of filtering, like ZeroWater filters, are certainly a better option, if you want to avoid bottles at all cost. But these methods of purification cannot differentiate between useful and non-useful ions: they filter acritically. Most importantly, they filter too much, for the purpose of tea brewing: resulting water has a TDS that is close to zero (it is almost a distilled water). Beside, both are quite expensive. Ultimately, if the source water is not good, it may end up being significantly less bad, but that does not mean that it will became a water that is suitable for tea. Acritically filtered water has no character and it lacks the balanced edges that good tea requires.

That is the scientific side.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif c2u0yv2hkw861...*

From a humanistic perspective, in a way, tea is a celebration of water. Just think about the aesthetic and the cultural context behind the practices of Â∑•Â§´Ëå∂ and Ëå∂„ÅÆÊπØ. It may sound silly, but through tea I fell in love with water and its sounds. I rediscovered that which I used to pay too little attention about: the beauty implicit into something so ordinary. Remarkably, I was reminded of the importance of water and of fighting for the environment that keeps it clean, in every other way that is available to me. I use magnesium BWT filters for drinking and cooking, and I try to do my part everyday, buying locally sourced, zero waste and organic as much as I can; recycling properly (glass and plastic bottles are easy to re-use and to recycle efficiently), using public transportation, not owning a car, paying for energy produced from renewable sources. If I take that into account, I believe I can still make a difference. Sometime, the ethical perspective needs to consider the aesthetic and strive to find a balance with it, otherwise life becomes merely functional, mechanical. Of all the possible reasons for using bottled water, preparing authentic eastern tea is the reasonable one for me. I believe something is lost in undermining the importance of prioritizing beauty, for a few things that you really love and that make you a better person: beauty is the reason the world deserves to be saved, and too often we forget to keep that goal **connected with the means we use to achieve it**. Tea culture and tea drinking help with that connection, if we let them. That is why it is called mindfulness.

My advice is not: use bottled water for your top quality teas. My advice is a little more complex than that, and it is rooted in the idea of self-made experience. Learning about water influenced my love of tea and changed my experience with it. So I am writing: please experiment with it, **before** choosing. Question your decision of avoiding bottled water for tea with an open mind to make a personal but **-informed-** decision. Find and buy a couple of bottles of a water that is great for tea: **TDS between 20 and 60 mg/l, slightly acidic PH, hardness &lt;3¬∞F, possibly poor in bicarbonates and rich in magnesium, calcium and silica**. Now try brewing a wide range of authentic, excellent eastern teas that you love in two teapots, maintaining the exact same parameters, but using the bottled water in the first, and the tap water you normally use, in the second. Wait, then possibly try again with a different kind of tea, until you sampled at least all the main categories. After that, if you find that the difference is something you can do without, or if you think the impact of your using plastic bottles is going to nullify every other effort you can make for the environment, or if you think that your tap water brew still honours the effort that tea makers put into crafting your special teas, then please stay with it! I shall happily rest my case, but at least you will base your decision on your own research and experience.

P.S. For the US eastern-tea aficionados, this enlightened tea vendor has many recommendations: [https://qifineteas.com/pages/water](https://qifineteas.com/pages/water). They even offer this very interesting, sophisticated solution to be used in combination with quasi-distilled water: [https://qifineteas.com/products/qi-fine-teas-formulated-water-series](https://qifineteas.com/products/qi-fine-teas-formulated-water-series).

For Europe, I can personally recommend: Sant'Anna, Lurisia, Levico, Mugniva, Surgiva, San Bernardo, Goccia di Carnia (Italy); Luso, Serra da Estrela (Portugal); Bezoya (Spain); Voss (Norway); Black Forest (Germany); Royal Deeside (UK); Mont Roucous (France).

I know it loses between 5-10C every hour depending on how much water is in it (and the starting temp) so I usually adjust brewing time to accommodate that.

I am starting to log my tea-drinking but rarely measure water temp before I brew and I thought 'it would it be great to have a Thermos jug that could tell you the temp before you poured' (instead of having to open the jug and measure the water with a thermometer every time) and lo, I found out temperature display insulated bottles exist.

However, they appear to be sold by electronics companies rather than reputable brands that sell insulated products (think Zojirushi, Thermos etc) and I haven't seen any that go above 525ml.

I've always read about the great benefits of real herbal tea (not that vending machine stuff), and I've always wanted to enjoy tea.

My mother is a tea drinker and I tried green tea. That was horrible on my system, so I thought I would dilute the taste. I quit after I hit 1 part green tea and 25 parts water. At 4% tea, the taste was either too strong and set my stomach off, or (to me) tasted bad. 

My question: is there a tea out there that is SUPER basic/easy?

tea,john-bkk,k3q80z,"Bamboo sheng pu'er, roasted tea","I reviewed a bamboo sheng pu'er.  I've tried falap before, a similar Indian tea, but never this type from Yunnan.  It was nice; quite approachable as young sheng goes, probably mellower due to the roasting process.  It tasted a good bit like bamboo too, with some other range like floral tones, dried fruit, and a touch of lemon.  Bitterness and astringency were even lower than for young sheng ""designed"" to be approachable, making me wonder how this would change further with age.  It didn't match the refinement, intensity, and complexity of good sheng but it was pleasant, and for novelty really interesting to experience.

Then I made 3 orders from MeiLeaf. 2 hours ago I did another big order full of samples from Taiwan Tea Crafts. I did the math. I ordered 33 different teas between 3g (1 white tea only) and 250g (went all in with Dong Ding and I've never even had one but I fell in love with Taiwanese Oolongs that I tried for first time this week).

I have 9 tins that can store 500g tea (3 of them can store up to 1kg). But 30 of these 33 teas are 25 or 50g (4-5x10g). The ones from Taiwan Tea Craft are not ziplocs I think and some of the MeiLeaf samplers are also not ziplocs. I suppose I cannot put them unsealed in the same tin as thry will absorb aromas and a cross-contamination will happen for sure (I've heard that tea is like a sponge for smells).

What should I do? My shopping addiction caught me unprepared. I tried my first Taiwanese Oolong and I was so blown away that I couldn't stop myself of ordering and ordering. I feel bad now. 

How do you store samples and smaller pouches of tea? Do you leave it in the pouch? 1035g tea with my 50ml gaiwan is not that easy to consume fast. And my ADHD will make me open all of them to try 2 different teas every single day until I try all of them. I guess I should just buy 30 tins lol. But I can't find smaller ones.

I tried a sample I got that's from a compressed cake twice now and feel it didn't turn out well either time. First attempt I had 2 primary chunks around 5grams, so 2x 2.5g. This was better than the 2nd attempt when I used 1x 5g chunk. Should I be aiming to use a single large chunk or multiple smaller pieces? 

I watched some videos and some people suggested letting the tea sit for 5-7 minutes after rinsing to let it open up because that seems to be my biggest issue. Even letting it sit after a rinse didn't really open it up. I'll brew 3-4 times with it still compressed and I feel it turns out very watered down and unenjoyable compared to a loose leaf brew that feels perfect from the first brew on. 

I just bought like 4 cakes, so this is quite disappointing since cakes seem to be all the rage. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but these just turn out so much less enjoyable than loose leaf tea that it's almost a complete turn off.",1609849844

Now there are several stores that sell ""Tie Guan Yin"" from this area ranging from 12-16‚Ç¨ per 100gr. and i have no idea if these are comparable to the one from ""Zhong Min Hong Tai"" or if they are bad too :D should i just order from one of these stores and try it?

tea,bogdanszonja,kqwndu,Advice for first gaiwan and teacup purchase,"I asked for some quality tea this Christmas (oolong, pu-erh and black) and I'm planning on buying my first gaiwan and cups for gong-fu brewing. The first thing I'm not so sure about is the proper size for the gaiwan and the cups for one, occasionally two persons. Also, I would like to ask your opinion about [Tangpin](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Tangpin) and [Teaware House](https://teaware.house/) they seem to be the most affordable ones but I'm not sure about the quality.

tea,Souprx,kqwdp3,Few stupid questions about brewing,"I see people talking about doing a session, what is this and how would you brew for it - I imagine it involves a teapot and a mesh ball?

I have bought a (probably gimmicky, but I like it) glass jug with mesh strainer from Brew Tea Co. It says its a teapot for 1 but it brews 400ml of tea with the leaves directly in the water so it needs pouring out to prevent over extraction. 

I struggle to believe that 400ml is a tea for one as most tea cups appear to come in sizes ranging from 200ml to 350ml. As such I am currently brewing my 'tea for one' and decanting it into what is essentially a sports direct mug - not quite the 'fine tea' experience I was hoping for.

In light of this, should I have bought a classic tea pot like a brown betty and a mesh ball on a stick with some actual fine tea cups?

Finally I bought some 'breakfast tea' with my fancy, gimmicky strainer jug and it seems like it was a pointless exercise as its no better than a twinings assam teabag. However, the earl grey is fantastic so I guess loose leaf tea is for finer / flavoured teas. 

The cauldron ceramics site has something about the design of the teapot allowing the leaves to swirl around inside it but with a 1L teapot this seems like a one way ticket to over extracted tea?

I have a reasonable order from Whittards coming with Oolongs etc that I'm excited to try. But i'm just not completely sold on my brewing vessel currently.

tea,KBrehm3,knht0b,Science Fair,"I'm doing a science fair project on how the concentration of tea affects tea's antibacterial properties. I am comparing two brands of green tea bags and two brands of green loose leaf tea. My units for concentration are mg of tea leaves / mL of water. I was planning on doing concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg/mL.

If I use tea bags, I am going to have to change the amount of water I'm using instead of the amount of tea leaves because there is a set amount of leaves in each bag. To do a concentration of 30 mg/mL, I need to brew tea with about 2 ounces of water. While I might be able to get it to be submerged, I'm afraid that there won't be enough water or space for the leaves to expand and the nutrients and polyphenols to be fully released. 

If I were to attempt to change this, adding two tea bags to change the amount of water won't solve the problem. The ratio still has to be the same and the ratio of tea leaves to water is what is causing the issue.

tea,dohrey,kn14ku,What actually happens when you age oolong or black tea?,"The aging of puer tea is talked about a lot and there seems to be a lot of consensus that the ""aging"" process is as a result of a combination of oxidation and microbial activity.


There also seems to be a decent amount of consensus (even if the aging process is not as developed) that for white tea the aging process is essentially a a result of oxidation.


But I am quite interested in what happens when oolongs and black teas are aged. 


Aging of oolongs seems to be relatively established but I can't find any explanation of what the ""aging"" actually involves - presumably it is not microbial activity given the general recommendation is that oolongs should be kept dry and cool whilst aging. Similarly, surely it can't be oxidation as the ""kill the green"" process in oolongs should stop this (unlike white tea or raw puer). Does anyone therefore know what the aging mechanism is or is it a mystery?


There also seem to be increasing numbers of vendors selling compressed black tea - mainly sun-dried Yunnan black tea. I have seen previous discussions here that aging there could be a result of further oxidation as with white tea, but could it also be the same as whatever process causes oolong aging? There seems to be some suggestion that aging could improve even non sun dried black tea - e.g. this aged black tea on teadb doesn't seem to be from Yunnan although I am not sure about its processing: https://teadb.org/2009-haoxin-hongcha-red-black-tea-episode-331/",1609329991

It is the kind where you have a plastic box inside where the water goes. 

Some people say the tray should be washed and dried after each use, but since so far I've been using it several times a day it feels a bit funny to wash and dry it after every use. Is it enough if I do this at the end of the day when I know I won't be using it anymore that day? 

I got the tray two or three weeks ago and I think some parts have maybe already turned a bit darker because of the tannins of the tea (I assume). Is this a sign I haven't taken good enough care of the tray or is it something that happens over time no matter what you do? Also, some people say you should oil the tray.

Green tea, black tea, and oolong. I even learned how to do Gong Fu brewing and all that, but now I'm seeing some people go crazy with matcha, so I want to try it. 

A few days ago I stopped by a Starbucks and ordered a matcha latte. I know, it's nowhere near close to the real thing, but that taste... it tasted like fish and cabbage. I had this happen with a Japanese Sencha that I made early on in my tea journey, and oh my God. That fishy and cabbage taste makes me gag so bad, so now I'm wondering if that's maybe somewhat close to what matcha tastes like? I cannot believe this kind of taste could possibly come from a few leaves, and I know for a fact it wasn't a spoiled beverage from Starbucks because I managed to recreate that taste when I made Japanese Sencha for the first time. I know now how to make it, and it's hard to get it right, but when I do it tastes great.

I just want to know if that kind of taste is prevalent in matcha or if Starbucks just really really sucks at making it. Getting into matcha seems pricey. At least for me, so I want to understand its flavor a little bit better.",1609069882

I am kind of new to tea world. I want to buy myself my first gaiwan and a set of 2-4 cups. I was browsing various vendors online, but almost all teaware I found was aesthetically boring or simply not pretty to me.

## Ancient Chinese porcelain

The only exception was porcelain at [The Essence of Tea](https://essenceoftea.com/collections/porcelain-teacups). I love their minimalistic hand painted Asian ornamentation. It's beautiful to me. I love this kind of raw, natural but at the same time pretty and sensitive aesthetics that's missing from almost all modern design.

## Price tag

The only problem are the prices - all of their teaware is very expensive. It seems to me it's so expensive, because they are faithful replicas of ancient porcelain from China. I don't know anything about ancient China porcelain and I don't care if something is an antique or not. So paying extra just because it's a faithful replica, is kind of waste of money in my case.

## Buy it cheaper?

*I wonder if you guys know some places, where I can buy something similar aesthetically, but for lower price? I would prefer it to be good quality and long lasting too.*

It doesn't have to be exactly the same, or even Chinese style. I don't know a lot about ancient Asian porcelain. Maybe I would like some Japanese or Vietnamese ornamentation too. I trust your judgement.",1609047237

New to tea, as my culture is really coffee heavy. 

Just last day I stumble upon two videos - one discussing how coffee will soon be unable to grow like today due to climate change, and one about pollutants in tea.

So a couple of questions, for those that got into this subject:

\- which is more susceptible to becoming scarce commodity, coffee or tea? 

\- I read Orwell's 10 points on tea, glorifying Indian teas (after what I managed to try, I prefer Assam teas). How polluted are Darjeeling and Assam plantations and air? How much of that do we get in our cups? Should we worry? :) Is living in the EU any better (as in do they test the teas being imported?)

\- Do you drink only tea, or do you combine it with coffee?

\- If only tea - what do you drink as a morning kick, and what through the day? Why?

\- Any other suggestion?

Three examples to illustrate my question: the puer boom started in 1995 when Taiwanese tea merchants bought up all the stock of Hong Kong stored puer. 
The modern Chinese black tea boom started in 2006 with the invention of jinjunmei and subsequent massive surge in domestic consumption and production of high quality black tea. 
And finally the white tea boom started only a few years ago in the 2010s with the invention of the marketing slogan ""1 year tea, 3 years medicine, 7 years treasure"" and publication of studies showing white tea's health benefits.

For Oolong I have a feeling that the boom began in the 80s with the sudden shift in production to greener styles, and seems like it might have also been driven by Taiwanese trends, like puer.

**Not too long; will read version**: I've got some extra cash and to celebrate my new gaiwan, I figured I'd buy some quality loose leaf tea! I currently have 5 loose leaf teas, and a fair number of bagged teas. I don't have much of any of the loose leaf stuff: dragonwell (dragonwell), lemongrass ginger green (source unknown), fujian rain oolong from Adagio, Aquarius (black + hazelnut flavor) from Adagio, Hojicha from YamaMotoYama. I'm thinking about a few things. Let me know what you think or if you have other ideas to recommend on how I can open Pandora's Tea Box for myself!

In the world of bagged teas, I tend to like green teas more than black teas, but that doesn't mean I dislike black tea! I don't have a ton of experience with white, puerh, or oolong.

Option 1: Liquid Proust. Either the LP Hookup (I entrust LP with my money and he picks for me) or the January Club (70g, 4 teas: bingdao shou, mori-mach, guafengzhai, dayi)

Option 2: Hatvala. I'd probably go with the Light Tea Collection (160g, 4 teas: 2 white and 2 green) but I'm tempted by the Dark (160g, 2 oolong, 1 sheng, 1 black) and the Oolong (160g, 4 oolongs)

Option 3: Verdant Tea. February ""tea of the month"" box (75g, mostly oolongs) and the 5 teas for $5 sample pack

Option 4: You suggest something totally different! I have heard great things about Yunnan Sourcing and White2Tea, and I also see Crimson Lotus and What-Cha high on the recommended-vendors list.

To be honest, I think I'm currently feeling *least* inclined to Verdant Tea, but I could be swayed (pretty easily). So yeah... that's that. Help me buy some tea so I can become more of a tea lover! Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôve been drinking tea since I was a kid and always enjoyed it. I drink it every day with my boyfriend and we‚Äôve never had any issues with brewing etc. But a few days ago, we both found our tea to be completely tasteless. It was literally like drinking hot water. He drinks a completely different brand from me so it couldn‚Äôt have been the tea itself. Anything else we drink/eat tastes normal, so it can‚Äôt be our own taste that‚Äôs off. Even stranger, I had a cup of tea at my mum‚Äôs yesterday, and it tasted completely normal. So it seems like it‚Äôs only the tea at my boyfriends house that is tasteless. We thought perhaps it was the kettle, so we cleaned it thoroughly yesterday, but the tea still tastes like water. Then we thought it was the water there was something wrong with, but everything else diluted with the water tastes normal. We have tried many different teas as of today with no luck. The only thing we can think of that we‚Äôve done differently than before is using a sugar shaker instead of adding sugar with a teaspoon. Could that be doing it? I can‚Äôt see how, other than the metal on the lid creating a sort of reaction somehow. What‚Äôs going on? Has this happened to anyone else before, and if so, how did you solve it?

But amount of choice is a little overwhelming, especially when I really don't want to waste my money on a high-quality tea that I don't particularly like. I tried two oolongs about a month ago (one very light, one darker) and they were nice but I  wasn't paying all that much attention to the nuance. I also tasted two pu-erhs last year - one tasted like riding a horse through an open field and one tasted like riding a horse through the woods, but both tasted like hay and I wasn't super into that. My experience with white teas is very limited, flavored or not. The only unflavored black tea I've ever had is english breakfast, which I liked (it was pleasantly nutty). I haven't had much green tea in general but I have had an unsweetened matcha that I accidentally turned bitter and had to add a bunch of milk.

My very favorite flavored teas are either flavored with nuts or raspberries. I generally like sweet, but I find it difficult to add any sugar to tea without making it too sweet. Tea with cream flavors is really nice too. Floral flavors are nice but also they often make me feel like I have to sneeze.

I do not like smokey flavors at all, not just in tea but in anything. I'm also generally sensitive to bitter flavors (I've taken to steeping my tea at the next highest kettle temperature setting below boiling). Heavily tannic drinks aren't my favorite, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I dislike them.

Any issue with pouring the water directly from the electric kettle into the cup ?

If I make myself a mug of tea (at least 30cL), as tea cups are ridiculously small, is a single tea bag enough in that case ? Should I let it brew longer according to the volume of water ?

Let's say one mug still wasn't enough, can I brew a single tea bag more than once or should I use a new one ? (I never did, don't kill me if that's an awful thing to say)

Milk, why ? How much ?

Any advantage in using leaves instead of tea bags ? I tried it but it felt more time-consuming for a similar result.

Just wondering if anyone's ever tried infusing alcohol into tea leaves and making tea bags out of them?

I've seen stuff like Merlot or Whiskey flavoured tea but those are purely flavouring with no actual alcoholic content.

How would one even go about doing something like this? My first thoughts were somehow soaking looseleaf tea in alcohol and re-drying but that probably wouldn't keep? And I'm not sure how much of the alcohol would be present. And if we're adding hot water to it, it might burn off the alcohol? What if the alcohol was turned into a solid form and we just added it to the tea bags with tea?

Full disclosure: My wife and I own a small tea room. I am not naming the name because I do not want to do any self-promotion. With the current restrictions, it has been hard on us to get a general bearing because we actually did this during the pandemic.

When you drink your tea, especially out, what types of food do you enjoy with them? Personally, I like the traditional egg salad and chicken salad. Tea has become a fun way my wife and I can bond through trying all the different types. 

Do you prefer to drink tea by the pot or made in a single-serve cup? I personally like a pot of tea if I know I'll be doing something for a while but a single-serve if I want to try a few that day.

tea,tante-sansa,lckig9,What are the advantages of using a small gaiwan?,"My gaiwan is quite big, about 200ml (6.8 fl oz).

If I fill my gaiwan with enough tea leaves to ensure I can do short steepings and also fill it up with water, that results in a lot of tea soup. More than I usually want to drink. 

Right now I'm adding a small amount of leaves and fill the gaiwan only 1/3 with water. I think that works quite well.

Would you recommend using a smaller gaiwan? If so, why?",1612458678

First steep 30 seconds, unsweetened
Very dark right, it looks like a light roast coffee off the bat. Still a bit of the fishy scent. I think that might just be a puer thing though? Can‚Äôt smell any roses. Likewise for the taste. Smooth and buttery. It‚Äôs a bit enjoyable for someone like me who prefers greens and whites.

Second steep 10 seconds 
Very much like the first, if not a bit more astringent. A slight bit of sugar in the second cup removed it though. 

Third steep 10 seconds
A bit less smooth. No rose taste yet. No astringency a bit lighter in color. 

Third steep 15 seconds 
Color is a deep honey color. A bit more of a fermented taste. Very slightly smoky as it cools. 

Fourth steep 20 seconds 
Freshly boiled water, at a medium honey color, fermented scent. I‚Äôm disappointed by the lack of a rose taste with this tea, it is a fairly nice tea though, for my first introduction to puer. The taste is very much the same as the other steeps, only just slightly weaker. 

Fifth steep 20 seconds 
Lost much of the taste now. I think this is the last one for the tea. 

The rose never came out in this cake, even slightly. There were no floral scents whatsoever, and it smelled fishy. It was very recently ordered so it wasn‚Äôt a matter of poor storage. 

It is a cheap tea for all the little cakes you get from it, but it‚Äôs underwhelming and lacking complexity to me. It‚Äôs fairly the same between each steep, although I really expected many more from a puer. Their page on it says you should be able to get seven from a Gaiwan but I don‚Äôt see how it is possible. I was given this to try from my sibling, but even she says she was underwhelmed and would not get it again. I suppose they‚Äôre idea for traveling with though. Just lackluster.",1612394905

One aspect I particularly appreciate from raw (sheng) puer's are the cha qi, specifically the highly relaxing, imaginative, intoxicating feeling which is most common in younger, raw puers. Hopefully you all know what I mean.

My question is: will puer that's been broken down from cake form and sitting for a period of many months (thus receiving more air exposure) achieve this property better/quicker than being stuck in a cake it's entire life and being broken down immediately before use?

Here's the situation: I purchased Bana's raw puer tea sampler and the tea I liked most (Mengsong Spring) didn't seem to have the same effect when I bought a whole cake from them recently.

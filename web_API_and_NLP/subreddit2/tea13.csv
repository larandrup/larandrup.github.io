White vanilla Grapefruit, Harney &amp; Sons, White Tea:

Temp: 82c / 179 f            Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz            steep time: 3 min

I'm not sure precisely where I got this tea since I've never bought Harney &amp; Sons before but I'm pretty sure that I 'borrowed' it from my workplace when the pandemic started. And for the price I payed it's pretty good. Upon opening the package I could immediately smell an unexpected strong musty smell that nicely transferred over to the actual brew. I'm unsure what precise ingredient give the tea this flavour, but it's a style that I'm definitely a fan of in black teas. Aside from the musky notes, this tea has quite the long lasting aftertaste which lingers pleasantly for several minutes after the initial tastes of vanilla have dispersed. I don't know if I agree with the description of this tea as grapefruit flavoured any more then I'd call bergamot grapefruit flavoured, but this blend definitely has a passing relationship with the light and airy notes of citrus. I would not recommend adding any sugar what-so-ever to this tea. I found that adding some turned the naturally strong and vibrant tastes into a cloying and suppressed flavour.     

Surprisingly enough the aforementioned mustiness of the tea does work when the tea is cold if that's something you're inclined to like, as I do, however I suspect that this iced tea is not for everyone. The same warning for sugar applies to this tea when iced; I didn't even finish my sugared cup of iced tea and I will not be adding sugar to it in the future.      

A word of warning for you all, the packaging and the website both say to steep it for 2 to 3 minutes with at a standard temperature for a white tea and they are not joking. The tetrahedral teabag helps it to brew quickly. I only steeped it for barely 3 minutes and it seemed a little too strong for my tastes, so this is not a tea that you can walk away from.     

I expect that I'll continue to have drink this tea if it's offered to me or if I find myself in the mood for something a little different, however this the will not be replacing my standard black teas nor will it be one of my recommendations for new tea drinkers. This is definitely a better choice for the a more refined palette looking for a boldly flavoured and textured tea.

I also have random mixes of wet chai, herbal teas, Yerba mate, and even some of those herbal tea jars you get from Asian groceries (citrus, ginger, ginseng)

Despite the variety of tea blends I have - my favourite brew is the straight sencha or oolong tea. My husband enjoys jasmine and sencha.

tea,YSS2020,l2zpna,"Loose leaf tea ""serving"" question..","I'm a little confused by say, Harney and Republic of Tea. They as well as a couple sites mention using one teaspoon per cup of tea. That would kind of make the word ""teaspoon"" make sense but, a teaspoon is only around 1 gram or so on average, maybe 1.5.

The same companies will sell 100 grams and say it makes 40-50 cups which is about 2g per cup. Most people also say simply 2-3g per cup.

I right off the bat just went by weight not volume and it's still a little weaker than I generally make my teas. I couldn't imagine only using one teaspoon.

I'm not sure but anyone have an idea why these companies say to use one teaspoon of leaf? Is there a special ""teaspoon"" not equivalent to the US measurement teaspoon that I'm missing?

I really don't care for myself. A digital scale is fine. I'm partially thinking of the bad reviews left by people talking about their tea tasting like hot water which would be expected when the company says to use one third to one half the amount of tea intended.

Volume-wise for loose leaf, a tablespoon generally winds up between 2-3g.

If anything maybe this will show up in google search results for people wondering why their loose leaf tea tastes like barely flavored hot water.

tea,josqvin,l2z99i,What the hell is this tea?,"I found this tea in my house somewhere: the wife is Chinese but doesn't drink tea herself and sometimes receives gifts. So it is certainly some mystery Chinese tea. I thought it might be some low quality gunpowder thing at first. But, upon inspection and brewing, the leaf is in these hard charcoal colored pellets, and even after a few brews, the pellets do not unravel or even expand much in size! As for the taste and color, it has that characteristic dark, pinkish hue of ripe puer. The aroma literally smells like some kind of Chinese restaurant stir fry garlic sesame vegetables dish you'd find in the strip mall of middle America. The taste is extremely dry and vegetal, kind of like bland stir fry broccoli or something. The wife doesn't even think it is tea at all, but it does seem somewhat similar to ripe puer I've had in the past and I think I feel caffeine.

While I wouldn't describe this tea as bland or bad in the slightest it failed to make much of an impact on me even though I'm personally quite fond of black teas in general and English breakfast in particular. This Private Selections blend was smooth and even with great tolerance for under and over steeping which just may be what you're looking for especially if you're looking for a solid safe bet for a nice cuppa tea.     

This tea was nicely complimented by adding just a dash of sugar (and I do mean a dash, a lit bit goes a long way with this blend) and the profile of this tea worked nicely when I had it cold with or without sugar. If you're looking for a blend to have for iced tea on a hot day, this is an excellent choice.

Tasting is the only effective method, through the normal brewing to understand the advantages and review, brewing to understand its shortcomings.

1.Brew normally. 
Different teas have different brewing methods, which will not be specified here. The aroma of tea soup, tea soup thickness, smoothness, aftertaste  to feel the characteristics of tea. Tea shop owner need to choose teas for different tea lovers. Therefore, if you can provide as rich flavor as possible under the condition of the minimum SKU, you can meet the preferences of more tea lovers and thus gain more customers.

2.Review brewing.
The necessary methods for professionals to judge the quality of tea. If the tea merchant does not have a professional evaluation cup, the appropriate extension of steeping time can be used to grab the shortcomings. 

Tea at any price  should not be a problem one. A problem tea is one that has an unusual aroma or taste.

But in fact, the definition of abnormality is very difficult to standardize, and there are sometimes statements in the market that a high carbon fire smell is chocolate or a musty smell is plum. Personally, I think the only criterion is whether you feel comfortable physically, regardless of whether it tastes like chocolate or plum. If the tea makes you uncomfortable, even if it really has such a flavor, you don't need to endure to taste it.",1611213143

I admit I don't know jack about tea except how to spell it. My budget is around $50 or so, give or take. I would really like help getting her something nice. 

I'm sorry for any errors. I'm on my phone. Thank you in advance.",1611201064
tea,tlonmaster,l1q5q3,Looking for some black tea/good place to buy from,"Forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this, I think since I'm the one asking it's okay? If not I can move it to a different place. :D I can't believe I never thought to check if there was a tea reddit!

I am primarily a black tea drinker (probably boring to some of you :D) but it's always what I've enjoyed. I grew up drinking Tetley, graduated onto PG Tips, and thanks to Teavana I eventually stumbled into the world of loose tea. It's been a favorite beverage of mine and I think I drink it even more that I'm out of work.   


I'm running low on tea right now, and I don't feel like going to NYC right now to get more. I was curious if anybody had any suggestions of good black teas and where to purchase them. I was looking at a site called Rare Tea Cellar, but I looked up reviews and found some less than glowing reviews, so I wanted some opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am drinking a Keemun Mao Feng and I was drinking Irish Breakfast. I'm looking for something like an Irish Breakfast tea, something strong/medium strength, but nothing flavored (though I will take recommendations!)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all, tea lovers!

&amp;#x200B;

Also - does anybody know where I  can get a similar blend to Teavana's old Joy tea? It was like oolong, black and green with apricot I believe. I used to love that one.",1611200389

I am a Coffee fanatic that also has the horrible habit of putting an absorbent amount of Hazlenut Creamer and Sugar into my coffee.

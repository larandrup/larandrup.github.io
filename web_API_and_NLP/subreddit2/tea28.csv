I want to find good tea distributors in Europe. So far I like Mei Leaf A LOT, although their teas are quite pricey and the shipping is kinda bad here in Germany.
I ordered from nannuoshan but I dont know how it is yet.
I dont want herbal tea, I mostly don't want scented teas. I'm just in for the loose leaf tea, preferably from China or Japan.

Can anybody help me with good recommendations?

[Mei Leaf Ya Shi Dan Cong \(Duck Sh\*t\) Oolong](https://preview.redd.it/4lhw97pwvb561.jpg?width=2700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940e9d811d9be71e8397861d90f797ed17e2036f)

This was my first dan cong ever. I expected some beautiful and intense fragrance but it's just bad. I had the highest expectations for this tea as it is **$1.11/g** \- used 6g in this 100ml gaiwan = $6.66 which is really expensive, nowhere near the other expensive tea I've got in the last 4 orders. I've got Mi Lan Xiang Dan Cong from What-Cha for $0.33/g and I haven't tried it yet, but it's more than 3 times cheaper and I bet, I hope that it will be better than this. This is the worst oolong I've ever tried while expecting to be the best. Did they mess up the packaging and gave me something else? It's from March 2020, the leaves are extremely dry and light and don't have any smell while dry and almost nothing while wet. It's also bitter, but the tea has almost no smell at all. I'm very confused. For some reason it got more fragrant at the 3rd infusion and the fragrance went away again at the 5th infusion. I used 99C hot water, 10 infusions 6g from the tea in 100ml gaiwan. Probably brewing it wrong, but I followed their instructions. I mean... it's not a bad tea... nevermind, it is. It's incredibly dry and slightly bitter and it has some vague floral notes, but it's very flat or I'm just bad at tasting and expected too much from it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry for the rant, I'm just confused. Can you explain what does ""dan cong"" actually mean? Is it just leaves from older trees in the Guangdong area? I bet it is not really from a single tree, but probably just older one? If it's from older trees, then it is normal to be more bitter and astringent I guess. I'm probably just dumb and very uneducated and don't know what to expect from a dan cong. Sorry. Can you recommend me good online vendors for dan cong? I want to explore more dan congs, aged whites and aged raw pu'erhs in 2021. This is my tea goal for 2021",1608030639

I've been using this for a week now. It can be in either Celsius or Fahrenheit (if you're having a hard time figuring out how to switch it from the manual, its just press and hold both the plus and minus buttons, took me a few tries to get it to switch). It goes up and down by 10 degrees f at a time or 5 c (I think, I don't use c). The most amazing part is that the tea I make from it tastes so much purer then any other kettle I've used before. So much purer in fact that I actually had to use more tea then I have before to be satisfied because it felt like it was so pure it was weak. Of course it is possible that me feeling like the tea was too weak is my own taste changing. But the water is far purer then other kettles I've had. It stays hot longer because of the insulation, even if you don't use the keep warm setting the kettle itself can keep it warm just by insulation. when not pressing the button to poor water its water tight. It heats up pretty quietly, and beeps pretty quitely as well. It is a little bit heavy because of the insulation but I don't think its unreasonably so. In real life it looks black unless you have the light hit it right, then you can tell that its actually a dark purple. It looks really good. It does have a bit of a short cord, but usually that shouldn't be much of an issue as places you'd usually place it shouldn't be that far from a outlet, its a bit over 2 feet of cord, which it has a spot on the underneath of the heating plate to wind it back up in. It has a button labeled rapid boil, if you ever just need some boiling water (assumably for something other then tea). it also seems to remember the last temp you used, for example I use 195 f for my black tea, I just press the + button and it immediately sets itself up to that temperature.

This was my first tea order in my life after someone here suggested me What-Cha 6 weeks ago. Meanwhile I ordered twice from MeiLeaf and once from Taiwanese Tea Crafts (after I fell in love with the Taiwanese ones I tried from MeiLeaf). What a journey! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my \*very strange\* experience - I feel like sharing what happened with you. It has happy ending :)

 Three people here told me that What-Cha orders arrive in a week and I was so sad that nobody contacts me from the local postal services. I received my other orders via DHL and UPS but with my last MeiLeaf order (free shipment from the Black Friday) arrived in the local post office and they put a message in my post box (what's the word in English? it's not my native language). It was soggy and almost ripped in parts almost disintegrated - I dried it and went with it to the local post office and... The lady there told me that I have a package for half of month sitting there and that it's scheduled for ""destroying"" in 5 days - my What-Cha package for over $100 that I was waiting for 34 days. But I knew that our local postal services are terrible and they don't even call us instead they come to the address, put a message somewhere instead of delivering directly the package. Anyway, I will know next time to visit the post office every 5 days, lol (I live near it, but I work from home and I became so lazy that I don't want to move my butt 100m away from home and imagine how lazy they are to destroy something that they can come and ring to my doorbell 100m away from them). End of story. Happy ending :)

This is my first Chinese tea ever. Embarrasing I know. I quickly fell in love in the last 30 days with the Taiwanese blacks and oolongs because they are so gentle, not bitter, not astringent and incredibly fragrant, so I almost thought that the Chinese would be ""worse"". Oh no no no. Big mistake, stooooopid brain of mine. This is absolutely amazing. Yes, it's very very very strong. It's also a little bitter but not astringent. And since I started using a gaiwan (stopped calling it gong fu, because someone called me out here that I should not call it gong fu brewing) and quit the sugar and almond milk (30 days ago) I knew that I couldn't drink any bitter teas without sugar. Again huge mistake. This is not too bitter, not like Indian teas, it's very gentle bitterness and it went away after the 5th infusion. I immediately thought about 60% chocolate, it's the most chocolatey tea I've tried. And it's not some vague note that I ""feel"" like trying to distinguish notes in other teas - it's clearly chocolate. You can't think of anything else. If I didn't know that it's a black tea, I would've guessed that this is a cacao shells infusion - the bitterness is exactly like a 60-65% darker but not very dark chocolate and the smell is exactly like cacao. It's perfect for cold winter mornings. Definitely the best black tea I've ever tried. I said the same tea a week ago about the Taiwanese Shanlinxi Qing Xin Black from Taiwanese Tea Crafts, but this Yunnan is bolder, stronger with simple but delicious smell and the slight bitterness wakes me up even faster, lol. I'd drink this as an everyday tea instead of the Shanlinxi - which is also incredible, but too gentle for early mornings.

&amp;#x200B;

What-Cha totally lived up to my high expectations and it deserves all the praise it receives and even more.

So i started drinking tea a couple days ago, and ive been watching mei leaf on youtube... he talked about being ""ea drunk"" in one of his video's, and said its a nice feeling and you get the best effects from the tea when you brew white, oolong, or green tea that has been aged gong-fu style, and that's the style i brew....

So i ordered and 8 year old aged white tea (quoted from source) "" cultivated in the 800 meters‚Äò mountain on Fujian province "" from china, and just some 2 year old jasmine tea....

So the first time i attempted to get tea drunk, i probably brewed about 5 grams maybe not even from these jasmine leave's and i drank 30+ cups (35ml gong fu tasting cups) and i felt alright... not really any different as om how he explained the effects to be, but i diddnt brew enough tea which makes sense... i just had a caffeine rush and felt genuinely good... Then after that i decided lets wait before i attempt this again, mainly because i diddnt want to feel like i was ""abusing the tea"" if there is such thing lol (i realize that sounds ridiculous, but now that i have felt a good ""tea drunk"" effect i understand it)

Now yesterday was interesting... i diddnt intend to get tea drunk but i just kind of did, and it was definitely an interesting experience and it was a stronger effect then i expected.... Basically i just really like tea, so since hte hour i woke up, til the hour when i went to bed, i diddnt stop drinking tea, other than when i went to the store to buy some tea lmao, but at night, when i finished probably my third or fourth liter (im not joking lol, i diddnt realize til i sat down and thought about how much i drank) of an aged white tea (with the odd pot of an 8 year old pu'ehr grown from the highest elevated tea treas in Taiwan and some milk oolong tea) i was just like damn.. things are kinda getting weird lol... 

i was super energetic probably from the caffeine but also very relaxed at the same time, and i couldn't really focus... i would get stuck on one thought that i couldn't stop thinking about (which is the same effect id get from smoking too much weed) or id just have no train of thought at all... id just feel as if the only thing's my brain could processes was what i was seeing but i also wasnt really impaired either despite this weird kind of psychedelic and subtle manic effect... and then as it started to die down a bit i just felt good... a little anxious but not really depressed lol, once it all finally weared off i had some shakes, i was very tired but in a relaxed sort of way and again pretty good...

So yeah that was my first experience from getting ""tea drunk"" and i was not expecting that at all, and i promise everything i felt was not placebo it was all genuine and i did not expect it at ALL to be so intense yet somehow subtle but i also cant wrap my head around how i diddnt really feel impaired at all at its peaks...

Anyone else ever get some insane effects off of tea? Id also like to point out that if your not brewing gong-fu or your not drinking aged tea (Preferably lighter teas) you may not have experienced this sort of effect if you were attempting to.. just throwing that out there because i read comments on other posts of people talking about how ""tea drunkenness"" is a myth and how they were never able to get this effect... Anyway what do you think and what were some of your experiences? PEACE!",1607907137

tea,galactalism,lpt6yw,How much do you spend?,"Hi friends,

I‚Äôm wondering how much do you guys pay per gram of really good tea with strong cha Qi sustainably and responsibly grown and all that? 

Is it worth it to you?

I‚Äôve been getting a lot of really positive benefits from my Gong Fu Tea and meditation practice over the last couple years. I‚Äôm just concerned that maybe I‚Äôm over paying trying to drink some of the finer teas. Yunnan sourcing is cheaper and has some wonderful teas. 

Sometimes I like to order from Living Tea which is more expensive but has a good selection of high vibration teas. I like clean teas. Sometimes old growth and/or aged. 

So I just payed 0.59 cents per gram of a selection of 2 Dian Hongs and one Oolong from Living Tea (including the shipping charge) it was 115 dollars for 196 grams of Tea total. Is this okay or do you think I‚Äôm overpaying? 

Does anyone recommend where to find very good quality and clean teas that are cheaper or is this just how much it should cost? 

Thank you!",1614012429

In truth, im trying to reduce how much juice, coffee, soda I drink. I thought tea might be a nice alternative to just plain old water if I just keep it unsweetened or tightly control added sugar. 

My question to you guys is how you would go about preparing it

- Do you think brewing it hot and just letting it cool is the way to go?

- Or would you just leave the tea in water in the fridge or at room temp? I even heard about some people leaving tea in the sun for some reason?

- on that thought, how bout water to tea ratio? Honestly, im planning to just use some cheap fruit flavored tea bags to try and keep it somewhat economical because its going to be for everyday drinking. Would you just do 1 bag per 8 oz of water?

- Any thoughts about what types of tea and or flavors would be good for this? Honestly, im completely inexperienced with tea because I live in FL and generally drink cold stuff because of the weather.

So I just had my first cup, ok two cups, of Tao of Teas first flush Darjeeling. And I see I have been missing something in my life. This is the first loose leaf tea I have ever made. So I am want to learn more to see what I should try next. 

I am looking for good black teas. No green teas for me. When I was stationed in Japan, the green tea would always give me a splitting headache.

Now, I know ""you get what you pay for"" is usually true. But I am not to the point of paying top dollar. I just want something that is enjoyable. So as awesome as a place like the Art of Teas sounds, most of their stuff seems beyond what I want to pay for now. At least until I narrow down what blends I like. 

I have looked at Harney &amp; Sons, Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate, and Vahdam. From reading around r/teas, it seems like Twinings  would not be a great option. I also need a little help figuring out what type to try next. There are just so many options. I would prefer something I can drink straight with no sugar, honey, or milk.

I‚Äôm looking for a black tea with low astringency but also with a nice mouthfeel and moderate complexly. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

H&amp;S English Breakfast: This is actually my favorite daily drinker (especially considering the price). H&amp;S says they this is a Keemun blend, so I figured that maybe I should find a higher grade Keemun. This led me to...

TeaVivre Keemun Grade 1: This is a nice, complex tea, but it has a moderate malt flavor, which I‚Äôm not quite sold on.

TeaVivre Lapsang Souchong Wild Black Tea: Extremely malty and sweet. Not at all what I was expecting!

YS Black Gold, YS Golden Monkey, YS High Mountain Red Ai Lao: All three of these teas are quite malty and hard to distinguish from each other (to my perhaps unrefined palate).

YS Wild Tree Purple: Really enjoyed this tea as it had only a hint of malt and is dominated by floral notes, but still tastes like a black tea. Would definitely buy again.

Pleasantly surprised my order arrived safely to UK in 22  days. If this was the case, I might have bought a smaller batch.

Just a brief summary as I haven‚Äôt tasted all the tea.

Good wrapping, they even threw in a free Pu-erh which is nice.

I  tried the Pure Gold Jin Jun Mei Black Tea of Tong Mu Guan Village  first, very good tea. The leaves were very delicate, so fuzzy and the  flavour was malty and sweet. More chocolaty and biscuit flavour than  expected, however it does have this medicinal after taste that I find in  some black teas and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me brewing it wrong, but  this is one expensive tea I wish I would enjoy more. Anyone else tried  the tea please let me know your thoughts?

My  only complaint is the Classic Wenge Wood Tea Table I bought is wonky.  The actual wood itself is very sturdy, heavy and well made. Really loved  it, until to my horror, when making my first brew my teaware was  wobbling around. Not impressed and have emailed Scott to see if they  will do anything about, not expensive, but majorly disappointed as I  won‚Äôt be using if it's unstable.

It tasted great both before and after I added a splash of milk and a little sugar (although in different ways). The problem is, I'm used to drinking a big ~700ml mug of coffee, so I was left wanting for more once I had finished the 200ml cup. Finally the actual question; Should I boil 600 ml of water and pour it over 3 tea bags in one cup, or boil 600 ml of water and pour 200 ml into 3 different cups, then after they've steeped pour them together?

TLDR: Make 600ml of tea in one cup, or in 3 cups then combine them.",1613811139

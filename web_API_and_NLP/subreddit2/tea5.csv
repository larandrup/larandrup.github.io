My favorite iced tea to brew is black iced teas.

I use two or three brands mainly, (Kilogram being one of them).  

I boil my water first in an electric water kettle.  I then as the hot water and black long leaf tea to the pitcher.  I let it steep for 15 minutes because I like my iced tea strong.

Once the 15 minutes is up I remove the tea leafs from the pitcher.

I always make sure to leave the pitcher out on the kitchen counter for hours to make sure it’s room temperature before I put it in the fridge.

But still after 3-4 hours on the counter the iced tea turns cloudy even though I never put it in the fridge while it was hot.

The tea tastes fine even though it’s cloudy but I’m just trying to figure out how to make it stop happening.

Thanks in advance!

tea,john-bkk,lk5lcc,"""Wild"" old-tree source Yongde sheng pu'er","There's less rambling about those interesting background conditions than is typical in this post, really just a description of the tea.  Wild-origin teas are an interesting subject that I've said a lot about tied to different examples.  The genetics of the plants varies a lot, and some of it isn't that close to standard Assamica used to make sheng (seemingly; processing and terroir differences factor in too).  

This version was sweet, heavy on citrus fruit, clean and balanced, with good intensity, and a really creamy feel (so a bit like an oolong, really).  Bitterness and astringency were quite low, typical for what I've tried of vaguely related teas.  A hint of tartness was unusual, but often versions are more atypical than that, sometimes sour instead, which can take some getting used to.  This tea was really pleasant, something I would like to drink regularly.

This sub got me curious about gongfu so I watched a video all about how brewing gongfu style basically makes tea exponentially better ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNO\_v8L2vI4&amp;ab\_channel=MeiLeaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNO_v8L2vI4&amp;ab_channel=MeiLeaf)). 

From the video, it seemed like the main difference is that gongfu uses way more tea leaves for the same amount of water and uses a shorter steeping time. So I was wondering if I would get a similar effect by putting a lot of tea in my western tea strainer (I have a large strainer that fits in my cup and would be easy to put more leaves in) then take the strainer out sooner. I could then re-steep like that for each cup. I know there is more involved in gongfu brewing like careful timing, water temps, aesthetics, etc. but would the process I suggested produce similar results? Am I missing a crucial aspect with this?

I may invest in a gongfu set at some point as I fall farther down the tea rabbit hole, but for now I'm wondering if there's a good way to get a feel for the different brewing results without buying any new equipment.",1613327013

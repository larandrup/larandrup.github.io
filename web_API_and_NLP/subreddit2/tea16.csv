tea,citykitty1729,ky57w6,Proper Usage of Vintage Teapot?,"I have a vintage teapot and some vintage (presumably collector's / decorative) fine teacups from my grandmother. I've kept them safe for many years, but unfortunately, I never really learned how to use them properly.

I could see if any of the individual cups / saucers might be worth reselling, but I'd much rather enjoy using them. Even though I wasn't allowed to touch them as a child, I think my grandmother would smile to see me enjoying tea in her teapot and teacups. :)

Before I just pour hot water and tea leaves or tea bags into potentially fine china, are there precautions I should take? I've seen suggestions for a ""warm rise"", not that I have any idea what that means, sadly. I have a modern stovetop tea kettle that whistles when the water boils - but I'm guessing that temperature would be too hot to pour into fragile, vintage bone china. (I'm not sure about the teapot, but at least one cup / saucer set is labeled ""bone china"".)

Any resources or advice you can offer a novice to the world of vintage teapots / tea sets? TIA! &lt;3 (My Google search terms are yielding mostly unrelated links...)",1610748687
tea,Nakedkill,ky56q2,Newbie with questions about oolong,"I bought some oolong tea, wanted to try something new from my genmaicha. I got some loose leaf that is fairly dark green and coiled. I prepared it in a simple way and could not get any flavor or taste.

I youtubed some gongfu tutorials and brewed it several time. I was able to get a bit of aroma, but tasted basically like water.

Does oolong when prepared correctly and of decently quality usually have flavor? Maybe I bought poor quality?

I'm definitely not very experienced in preparing tea but I would think I would have found a decent improvement. Or is oolong a very bland tea?",1610748585

The only tea I had experienced up to that point was tea bags and although I loved them I would only drink it for the light caffeine pick me up. This video started my new hobby / borderline obsession with tea.

When the pandemic began I coped through tea, it helped me feel connected to the world by learning how it was produced and the attention and care that went into it. My college used to offer a course on tea and tea culture but unfortunately it does not anymore and I was wondering if there were any online courses that I could take that could give me a detailed, unbiased education on tea (I absolutely love meileaf videos but at the end of the day they are still trying to sell me a product)

I went to a local shop called the lancaster spice exchange, looked around a little, asked some questions, and left, 4 different blends to try.

I’ve finally purchased the Cosori mug warmer (including mug), and I highly recommend it to all the tea drinkers out there that get easily distracted like me and end up with cold tea. 

I’ve been using it for the last 3 days and I am pleasantly surprised how effective it is.

Anyone that’s used a hotpot machine or familiar with an induction hob can expect these mug warmers to get pretty hot. I’ve had my cup on the provided stainless steel cup for like nearly 3hrs straight and it kept my tea perfectly warm at the desired temperature (70c for me) But can be adjusted  anywhere from min 25c to max 110c . It heats up pretty quickly. It just heats up even without anything placed on top.

Also be aware the heat does go through to the bottom of the device and I've noticed my desk getting slightly warm, so I've placed some heat proof mats just incase it damages my desk. 

As the provided cup is metal, if you kept it heated for too long it does make it too hot for the lip, so just need to be careful and turn it down abit if its scorching. 

I’ve tried using my own ceramic mugs that is not flat base and it works. It can keep the tea warm but you really have to turn it up to make up for the heat its losing, if you have a lid it helps. 

Overall I highly recommend it.

tea,chaqintaza,kwqboy,Charcoal stove and kettle?,"Hi, does anyone have recommendations for charcoal stove and kettle combos (sold together or that are of similar dimensions) for gong fu purposes?

There's a pic of a nice set in this blog post: [https://deathbytea.blogspot.com/2015/07/i-shaved-my-face-for-this.html](https://deathbytea.blogspot.com/2015/07/i-shaved-my-face-for-this.html)

I am not talking about samovars, but rather relatively compact stoves that work with similar-sized kettles. Thanks!",1610573121
tea,Tea-Cats,kwq3f6,"Just came in, my new travel set. It's not very high quality but really cute and handy. Cat themed, two tea cups of different size and japanese style/shiboridashi tea pot. It has nice travel bag and a small towel. Fits really nice in hands, has a good water flow. I can't wait to try it out. 🥰🍃🍵",,1610572472
tea,Jkolinski32,kwpxkh,Tea similar to Teavanna Winterberry,"The only hot tea I’ve ever really enjoyed way the Teavanna winterberry. Since that’s not really accessible any more, does anyone have any suggestions on something very similar. I’m also open to suggestions for kinds that are a little different but still close. Thanks in advance!",1610572016

tea,georgejunglist,lasss2,A couple of tea questions by a noob :),"And to expand a little;

New to tea, as my culture is really coffee heavy. 

Just last day I stumble upon two videos - one discussing how coffee will soon be unable to grow like today due to climate change, and one about pollutants in tea.

So a couple of questions, for those that got into this subject:

\- which is more susceptible to becoming scarce commodity, coffee or tea? 

\- I read Orwell's 10 points on tea, glorifying Indian teas (after what I managed to try, I prefer Assam teas). How polluted are Darjeeling and Assam plantations and air? How much of that do we get in our cups? Should we worry? :) Is living in the EU any better (as in do they test the teas being imported?)

\- Do you drink only tea, or do you combine it with coffee?

\- If only tea - what do you drink as a morning kick, and what through the day? Why?

\- Any other suggestion?

Thank you!",1612262215

tea,josqvin,lamvyu,Seeking information on modern oolong boom,"I would like to know more about the modern history of oolong, i.e. when did the modern boom happen (oolongs are seemingly the most expensive of all teas) and who were the drivers of the boom?

Three examples to illustrate my question: the puer boom started in 1995 when Taiwanese tea merchants bought up all the stock of Hong Kong stored puer. 
The modern Chinese black tea boom started in 2006 with the invention of jinjunmei and subsequent massive surge in domestic consumption and production of high quality black tea. 
And finally the white tea boom started only a few years ago in the 2010s with the invention of the marketing slogan ""1 year tea, 3 years medicine, 7 years treasure"" and publication of studies showing white tea's health benefits.

For Oolong I have a feeling that the boom began in the 80s with the sudden shift in production to greener styles, and seems like it might have also been driven by Taiwanese trends, like puer. 

Anybody have any information or sources to share on this?",1612238418

tea,RareBlackbird,lagwlr,Help me spend my money!,"**TLDR version**: I have around $45 to spend, I'm new to gong fu, what should I buy?

**Not too long; will read version**: I've got some extra cash and to celebrate my new gaiwan, I figured I'd buy some quality loose leaf tea! I currently have 5 loose leaf teas, and a fair number of bagged teas. I don't have much of any of the loose leaf stuff: dragonwell (dragonwell), lemongrass ginger green (source unknown), fujian rain oolong from Adagio, Aquarius (black + hazelnut flavor) from Adagio, Hojicha from YamaMotoYama. I'm thinking about a few things. Let me know what you think or if you have other ideas to recommend on how I can open Pandora's Tea Box for myself!

In the world of bagged teas, I tend to like green teas more than black teas, but that doesn't mean I dislike black tea! I don't have a ton of experience with white, puerh, or oolong.

Option 1: Liquid Proust. Either the LP Hookup (I entrust LP with my money and he picks for me) or the January Club (70g, 4 teas: bingdao shou, mori-mach, guafengzhai, dayi)

Option 2: Hatvala. I'd probably go with the Light Tea Collection (160g, 4 teas: 2 white and 2 green) but I'm tempted by the Dark (160g, 2 oolong, 1 sheng, 1 black) and the Oolong (160g, 4 oolongs)

Option 3: Verdant Tea. February ""tea of the month"" box (75g, mostly oolongs) and the 5 teas for $5 sample pack

Option 4: You suggest something totally different! I have heard great things about Yunnan Sourcing and White2Tea, and I also see Crimson Lotus and What-Cha high on the recommended-vendors list.

To be honest, I think I'm currently feeling *least* inclined to Verdant Tea, but I could be swayed (pretty easily). So yeah... that's that. Help me buy some tea so I can become more of a tea lover! Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôve been drinking tea since I was a kid and always enjoyed it. I drink it every day with my boyfriend and we‚Äôve never had any issues with brewing etc. But a few days ago, we both found our tea to be completely tasteless. It was literally like drinking hot water. He drinks a completely different brand from me so it couldn‚Äôt have been the tea itself. Anything else we drink/eat tastes normal, so it can‚Äôt be our own taste that‚Äôs off. Even stranger, I had a cup of tea at my mum‚Äôs yesterday, and it tasted completely normal. So it seems like it‚Äôs only the tea at my boyfriends house that is tasteless. We thought perhaps it was the kettle, so we cleaned it thoroughly yesterday, but the tea still tastes like water. Then we thought it was the water there was something wrong with, but everything else diluted with the water tastes normal. We have tried many different teas as of today with no luck. The only thing we can think of that we‚Äôve done differently than before is using a sugar shaker instead of adding sugar with a teaspoon. Could that be doing it? I can‚Äôt see how, other than the metal on the lid creating a sort of reaction somehow. What‚Äôs going on? Has this happened to anyone else before, and if so, how did you solve it?

tea,podsnerd,l92fqq,I love flavored tea: where should I start with non-flavored tea?,"I have really been enjoying flavored teas for a while, but I'd like to explore what tea can be like on it's own. But amount of choice is a little overwhelming, especially when I really don't want to waste my money on a high-quality tea that I don't particularly like. I tried two oolongs about a month ago (one very light, one darker) and they were nice but I  wasn't paying all that much attention to the nuance. I also tasted two pu-erhs last year - one tasted like riding a horse through an open field and one tasted like riding a horse through the woods, but both tasted like hay and I wasn't super into that. My experience with white teas is very limited, flavored or not. The only unflavored black tea I've ever had is english breakfast, which I liked (it was pleasantly nutty). I haven't had much green tea in general but I have had an unsweetened matcha that I accidentally turned bitter and had to add a bunch of milk.

My very favorite flavored teas are either flavored with nuts or raspberries. I generally like sweet, but I find it difficult to add any sugar to tea without making it too sweet. Tea with cream flavors is really nice too. Floral flavors are nice but also they often make me feel like I have to sneeze.

I do not like smokey flavors at all, not just in tea but in anything. I'm also generally sensitive to bitter flavors (I've taken to steeping my tea at the next highest kettle temperature setting below boiling). Heavily tannic drinks aren't my favorite, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I dislike them. 

So, what are some varieties I should check out to start? I'm not necessarily looking for a specific brand, but names of varieties",1612060597

tea,BarelyBearableHuman,l8yntu,Really basic questions on basic tea brewing,"Tea is not as popular, here, in France. I'm the one and only member of my family who hates coffee. Since I'm drinking more and more tea, I want to make it without offending all of Britain so I have a few  (stupid ?) questions :

Any issue with pouring the water directly from the electric kettle into the cup ?

If I make myself a mug of tea (at least 30cL), as tea cups are ridiculously small, is a single tea bag enough in that case ? Should I let it brew longer according to the volume of water ?

Let's say one mug still wasn't enough, can I brew a single tea bag more than once or should I use a new one ? (I never did, don't kill me if that's an awful thing to say)

Milk, why ? How much ?

Any advantage in using leaves instead of tea bags ? I tried it but it felt more time-consuming for a similar result.

I looked it up a bit before posting, but I didn't find answers to some of my specific questions, probably because they're really obvious to anyone who grew up around tea drinkers, but I didn't so here I am.",1612049050

tea,propofolo,l8yfjs,Alcohol-infused tea?,"Hello, 

Just wondering if anyone's ever tried infusing alcohol into tea leaves and making tea bags out of them? I know there's a lot of infusions out there where tea leaves are steeped in vodka but was just wondering if anyone's done the opposite? I've seen stuff like Merlot or Whiskey flavoured tea but those are purely flavouring with no actual alcoholic content.

How would one even go about doing something like this? My first thoughts were somehow soaking looseleaf tea in alcohol and re-drying but that probably wouldn't keep? And I'm not sure how much of the alcohol would be present. And if we're adding hot water to it, it might burn off the alcohol? What if the alcohol was turned into a solid form and we just added it to the tea bags with tea?

TLDR: I want to make boozy tea bags for a project. Has anyone ever tried doing something like this?

Thanks!",1612048406

Full disclosure: My wife and I own a small tea room. I am not naming the name because I do not want to do any self-promotion. With the current restrictions, it has been hard on us to get a general bearing because we actually did this during the pandemic.

When you drink your tea, especially out, what types of food do you enjoy with them? Personally, I like the traditional egg salad and chicken salad. Tea has become a fun way my wife and I can bond through trying all the different types. 

Do you prefer to drink tea by the pot or made in a single-serve cup? I personally like a pot of tea if I know I'll be doing something for a while but a single-serve if I want to try a few that day.

If I fill my gaiwan with enough tea leaves to ensure I can do short steepings and also fill it up with water, that results in a lot of tea soup. More than I usually want to drink. 

Right now I'm adding a small amount of leaves and fill the gaiwan only 1/3 with water. I think that works quite well.

First steep 30 seconds, unsweetened
Very dark right, it looks like a light roast coffee off the bat. Still a bit of the fishy scent. I think that might just be a puer thing though? Can‚Äôt smell any roses. Likewise for the taste. Smooth and buttery. It‚Äôs a bit enjoyable for someone like me who prefers greens and whites.

Second steep 10 seconds 
Very much like the first, if not a bit more astringent. A slight bit of sugar in the second cup removed it though. 

Third steep 10 seconds
A bit less smooth. No rose taste yet. No astringency a bit lighter in color. 

Third steep 15 seconds 
Color is a deep honey color. A bit more of a fermented taste. Very slightly smoky as it cools. 

Fourth steep 20 seconds 
Freshly boiled water, at a medium honey color, fermented scent. I‚Äôm disappointed by the lack of a rose taste with this tea, it is a fairly nice tea though, for my first introduction to puer. The taste is very much the same as the other steeps, only just slightly weaker. 

Fifth steep 20 seconds 
Lost much of the taste now. I think this is the last one for the tea. 

The rose never came out in this cake, even slightly. There were no floral scents whatsoever, and it smelled fishy. It was very recently ordered so it wasn‚Äôt a matter of poor storage. 

It is a cheap tea for all the little cakes you get from it, but it‚Äôs underwhelming and lacking complexity to me. It‚Äôs fairly the same between each steep, although I really expected many more from a puer. Their page on it says you should be able to get seven from a Gaiwan but I don‚Äôt see how it is possible. I was given this to try from my sibling, but even she says she was underwhelmed and would not get it again. I suppose they‚Äôre idea for traveling with though. Just lackluster.",1612394905

One aspect I particularly appreciate from raw (sheng) puer's are the cha qi, specifically the highly relaxing, imaginative, intoxicating feeling which is most common in younger, raw puers. Hopefully you all know what I mean.

My question is: will puer that's been broken down from cake form and sitting for a period of many months (thus receiving more air exposure) achieve this property better/quicker than being stuck in a cake it's entire life and being broken down immediately before use?

Here's the situation: I purchased Bana's raw puer tea sampler and the tea I liked most (Mengsong Spring) didn't seem to have the same effect when I bought a whole cake from them recently.

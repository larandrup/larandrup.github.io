tea,CaptainSkunkBag,k7dggs,I'm a bit lost need some help and treasure Green tea company.,"So after stopping in this sub to figure out how to brew my tea bags better and about a week of lurking later, I'm ready to go all in on Chinese style brewing. Initially I had a whole order on yuinns sourcing redy but with the shipping costing me over $200  I decided to try and find somewhere domestic in Canada to get everything. I was looking for a website that's a one stop shop, somewhere I could get aesthetically pleasing tea ware as well as quality tea.

I found way down in the side bar a Canadian shop https://treasuregreen.com they have all the tea ware selection I am looking for but it is pretty expensive, with some of it being insanely expensive. I'm not sure if they just stock really nice stuff or they charge to much. Now where I am truly lost is selecting tea from them, I have no idea what I'm looking for or what's quality and what's not. I mostly right now drink black tea, Earl Gray and chi. I basically want to try some quality black tea, green tea, oolong and pu-erh. I want to try all the main categories of tea and start developing and figuring out what I truly like.

Does anybody have any experience buying with treasure green? Or could help me out with selection from them?  I know there are probably better places to order from in the sidebar but I want all of this to arrive before my family comes down at Christmas. I've looked at so many of the sellers in the sidebar and other than Yuinns this place seems to have a great selection of tea ware and tea compared to others.

Curious if anyone noticed the difference between decaffeinated tea and their unaltered counterparts in general. I realize the decaffeinating process does strip the tea some of its health benefits and inevitably affects the tea flavors at the chemistry-level but curious if anyone actually notices these nuisances in e.g. the versions of a tea bag brand where i assume the flavors are already ""brought down to a common denominator"" from the processing vs. loose leaf alternative.",1607183168

I took my first stab at growing camellia sinensis this year. I've encountered a few issues and was hoping you all could help me out. The plants were growing well throughout most of summer but sometime around mid-August yellow leaves began appearing along with brown spots on the healthy leaves. I have tried searching all over for the cause, but I can't find anything like what is happening to my plants. Once a brown spot appears, it spreads and the leaf eventually falls off. New, healthy leaves are still growing while this is happening. 

The plants are potted in miracle grow fast draining soil with just a bit of Dr. Earth acid loves mixed in. I have not fertilized or added anything since they were planted in spring. To help with soil draining I added some stones in the bottom of the pot prior to putting the soil in. I water them about once a week, making sure the soil is somewhat dry before watering again. They were outside all summer, but I have brought them inside recently for winter. The problems started prior to bringing them inside.

Much to his chagrin  I loved it. Smoky, peaty, sweet and warm. It was heaven in a glass and I have not looked back. Every morning since ( he unloaded all his tea on me)  I have drank a cup of lapsang souchong to start my day and I am losing enthusiasm for coffee.

However, my asthma has been acting up and I can't figure out why. Suddenly it hit me that perhaps the lapsang souchong was culprit. Although I think my asthma has been acting up a little before my first cup.

I desperately want this not to be the case, because I am in love with this tea. I have even ordered more varieties off the internet. 

A quick Google didn't bring anything up and I don't have a doctors appointment until Thursday , so I am putting it out to r/tea hoping that there are some lapsang souchong lovers with antecedotal evidence on the subject or a tea expert who can enlighten me.

I've been drinking Lapsang souchong for many years.

The last few years I've noticed that different Lapsang from different shops can vary a lot.

I like them real tarry/smoky, but some Lapsang mostly resembles plain black tea(!!)

I am sure there's variety with different blends/brands and that's fine, but I haven't had a really satisfactory cup of ""bog water"" for years and that's *not* fine! =-(

Even my last order I had from the shop that used to serve me real good lapsang was dissappointing.

Is this because:

1. I am less sensitive to the smoky quality of the tea?
2. It could be a different brand or just older tea (because it's a small local shop)?

I really hope it's not option 1! =-D  

I doubt you can answer that, but can you answering me on:  


Is lapsang suspectible to long or bad storage? I am inclined to assume the smoky aroma is volatile.

  
If I want to find the smokiest/tarriest Lapsang, I have to try international tea shops, right? (tea bought locally in my small country can be old).  
I've avoided buying from international shops as transport fees to Norway can be really expensive. It might be something I'll have to try, though, and maybe try 2+ different brands simultanously, as side-by-side comparison may be the best way to compare brands. 

Is lapsang in satchets (""bags"") fine, or should it be loose tea in an air tight box?  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

tea,bigballsblues,k6ku1j,Just ordered my first brick of Sheng Pu-Erh and Ive got some questions,"The past few months I've been browsing the internet, primarily looking at teas and incenses. Just a little while ago I was looking around on the Harney and Sons website, as I was ordering a new tin of CTC Assam (one of my favorites) and I came across a tea called something along the lines of 2007 Sheng Pu-Erh, something I hadnt ever heard of before. It seemed interesting so i clicked on it. And then the image came up and I realized that, it was a tea i had before, and I remember absolutely loving it. So at this point I knew i had to get some.

After some research I figured out that what I probably had unknowingly been drinking was an aged variety of Pu-Erh, so I began looking at those. 

I found a 1.5oz brick of Mid-90s Pu-Erh on Livingteas, I read the description and it just felt right as to what i was trying for. So after some careful deliberation between a few different vendors and teas I went with that one. 

Now, my questions are as follows

I was more than likely brewing the tea I had a few years ago quite wrong (Full boiling water, 4-6 min steep time)
What can I do to make my experience with it better this time around?

How long should a brick of this size last? 

How should I store it? 
I remember the previous brick I had began to get *extremely* dry and brittle after about a month of having it. If you are wondering how I acquired it without knowing it was Pu-Erh, I was at a friends house whilst having tea and they mentioned they had a ""brick"" of tea they wanted me to try (which confused me at the time, i didnt know tea could come in a brick), which was the Pu-Erh, after I had tried it I told them that I very much enjoyed it and they took about a 0.5oz piece off of what they had (would estimate around 2.5 oz is the size they had). I had just had it stored in a ziploc bag in a cupboard.

Unfortunately, my anxiety disorder really *doesn't* want me to, because too much caffeine sets it off. SO! I'm looking for good caffeine-free tisanes. I love herbal teas and floral teas and I'm looking to avoid any added sugar/sweetener. I'll leave my fav linked below for y'all to check out too!! Thanks in advanced.

tea,BozoSkipper,k6e59v,Recommendations,"Hello! 
I️ am more of a coffee person, but find myself going through tea “phases”
I️ have just recently started getting into teas more. An old coffee shop I️ worked at had a ton of different teas that I️ would try. 
1. I️ really like black tea (earl grey or English breakfast)
2. I️ enjoy tea strong. With no milk or sugar
3. I️ drink oolong but don’t love it
4. I️ don’t like herbal, green, or white. 
I️ am looking for any suggestions to what other kinds of tea to try. And white, green, or herbal that are crowd favorites? What other “exotic” types of tea do you recommend?",1607057537

tea,Daniel_Chumgus,k6dzto,Looking for a tea in Ottawa,"Obligatory on mobile

Two or three years ago, my best friend went on a trip to Ottawa and found a loose leaf tea called ""Evening Jazz"" at a local tea shop. 

After coming home we both have scoured the internet and have no leads on where to possibly find it.

I want to get some for him for Christmas this year but even after trying to find information on local tea shops in Ottawa and comparing every source to his memory, I haven't been able to locate the correct tea. 

Any help or leads to find this tea would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! &lt;3",1607056782

tea,Downtown_Volume_2811,k6cywn,Tall thin shiboridashis?,"I’ve been seeing more slender shiboridashis with tighter/slower pours. What sort of tea would be best suited for a vessel like that? I guess I just don’t understand the advantage of this and want to know because I think they are neat. 

It would also be helpful for some insight on why someone would choose a gaiwan vs shiboridashi or vice versa. I know smaller wider shiboridashis are usually used for temperature sensitive teas with longer leaves, but there are so many shapes and sizes of shiboridashis that it makes me think maybe I should try one for other sorts of teas, too. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Info about how houhins fit into all this would be helpful as well!",1607052847

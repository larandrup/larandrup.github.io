tea,tomrob1138,k8shx3,"Hello, I need some help pls...","Hey All,
 I am looking into getting my fiance a decent tea set for her birthday and building a cabinet to hold it.

My question is, should I get ceramic or cast iron? I was looking at the smaller kinds like the Japanese? type. 
She likes tea, but doesn't know a ton about it, and mostly she would probably be using bags at first at least. 

I wasn't sure if the ones off Amazon are good enough or to be avoided. I want to try and keep it under $100 for the set(just two cups) but if I need to get a certain one thay is quality I can get just the pot for the time being.

Also, for bonus points. Where is a good place to order/get tea from? Health food store good enough or somewhere specific has the good stuff?

Thank you in advance!",1607384292

Today's tea was an oolong tea, which is something I've never tried before, but wanted to try for a while. 

I've been thinking of trying Gong-fu and getting a Gaiwan, found a nice one in glass online. Been thinking of getting it specifically for oolong and pu'er, to properly taste them. 

Should I wait with trying the oolong until I have the possibility to Gong-fu it, or should I try brewing it in a cup?

I drink st. jhons wort, lavendeer,  chamomile and linden tea.

So the way i make my team is that i brew around 3 baggies of st. jhons and 3 of lavendeer in 800ml of water, and thats 2 cups in the morning. Those 6 baggies i do them one more time for 1 cup in the evening before sleep.

Also i like to make my chamomile solo and i make it intense because it calms me alot, 2 big cups a day, sometimes 3. In the afternoon ill have 2 and maybe 1 in the morning and play around betwen chamomile and lavendeer and st. jhons.

And linden tea from time to time again intense style.

Oh yeah and ginger but since i dont have any more room for drinking, i decided to chew on some ginger from time to time, instant calm and relief.

Is it safe what im doing ? Mixing teas together ? And drinking such a variety every day ?

I have never felt more calm and stable and ballanced in my life, and so much positive emotion coming from these teas, i used to be a wreck of stress and anxiety and negative emotions so anything that relieves me of these and makes me balanced and stable and worry free and content im gonna have alot of that please.

I was catching up with a friend today and he mentioned that he was once able to find a blackcurrant tea that he really liked, but it appears to have been taken off the market. He described it as being Ribena-like (Ribena is a very sugary blackcurrant drink available in the UK). Any thoughts on best available blackcurrant tea (or even most Ribena-like blackcurrant tea)?",1607214402

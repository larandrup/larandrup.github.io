tea,ninuchka,kwm25m,New and seeking recommendations for excellent and interesting unflavored Assams/blends for daily milk tea,"Sorry, I know that versions of this question get asked regularly; I've been through the archives and would still love some direct advice. I've been making my best attempt at (unsweetened) milk tea for the last year with Positively Assam. It's strong, smooth, malty and affordable, but I'm curious about alternatives. In the past, I've enjoyed Red Blossom Tea Co.'s Formosa Red 18, but Taiwanese red/black blends appear to be too expensive for daily drinking. Murchie's Storm Watcher was not as complex as I had hoped. Years ago, I drank a range of Harney teas, including Milima, and have been looking at East Frisian as a possible candidate. Are there other excellent Assams/blends that folks would recommend for this purpose? (I'm in the US in terms of sourcing. I will probably try Smith's Portland Breakfast because it's regional, and peat and leather are two of my favorite fragrance notes.)

I am also wondering about process. At present, I boil the water, allow it to cool briefly, then steep a good four heaping teaspoons before adding (whole grass-fed) milk to the pan and straining. The resulting 2 cups are tasty, but I go through tea very quickly and have no idea if this is the best method.

Thanks in advance for any advice. Making and drinking tea are such important rituals for me, especially during covid. I'm glad to have found this sub.",1610561104

(2 min steeping time for all Oolongs and 3 mins steeping time for all blacks),"I personally never brew tea at boiling point unless I'm drinking an herbal tea. I also brew my teas both Western and Gongfu style depending on my mood.  I just don't like the astringency, bitterness, and darker flavors that come out of the tea as a result of brewing at the 96-100°C range. Based on my personal experience, even the heavily oxidized teas such as Da Hong Pao and Lapsang Souchong taste like they should when brewed at 90-95°C. However, what I do notice is that the nutty, woody, and dark flavors take a backseat to the lighter, mellow, brighter, and floral flavors when brewed at 90-95°C. When brewed at the 96-100°C range, the tea becomes stronger and sometimes the flavor even leaves a really strong kick in the mouth.

As for steeping time, I usually stick to 2 mins for all Oolongs and 3 mins for all Black Teas when brewing western style.. For Gongfu style, I usually start with 15 secs and increase each interval by 5 secs. These time intervals seem to work perfectly for me.",1610473847

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a tea junkie since I was in primary school, for some reason I loved tea at such an early age, I guess I got that from my dad who really loves tea lol

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what brand of tea we used to use, but it was really good. This is just a guess, but maybe it could have been Clippers? I don't think I ever saw the teabag box, maybe once, my memory is really bad so I can't remember but it kind of looked like the Clippers box, so it could've been that, we bought all our groceries from tesco.

&amp;#x200B;

when we moved house a few years ago, we switched to Lidl because it was way cheaper to buy groceries there, my parents started to buy Knightsbridge Gold tea bags, at first I couldn't really taste a difference, didn't even know we switched tea bags, but recently they've started to taste really bad, I have no clue to why they do. I use sweetener (aspartame based tablets from tesco) to flavor my tea but I also used to use and still use sugar sometimes to flavour it, recently the tea has been tasting really strange, I can't explain it, it tastes so strange.

&amp;#x200B;

It is kind of an icky/heavy taste, but it doesn't taste that bad or ""icky"" in the normal sense, but if you drank more than a cup of this tea you'd feel sick, it's the flavor of this tea I think, but it's just strange since I think we bought this tea from the start of moving house, could be wrong though. Has anyone else tried this company, the Knightsbridge Gold teabags?

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to try out yorkshire gold teabags, bought it online and waiting for it to arrive, I hope it is better :D

&amp;#x200B;

also thoughts on aspartame in tea? I don't think the sweetener is affecting the tea too badly, as this has happened recently and I tried this same tea with brown sugar and it has the same weird taste/heaviness, it's hard to drink a cup of it, it's to do with the flavor/taste of it, or maybe it's just a changed appetite, who knows lol.",1610438771

tea,josqvin,kvjmg9,What Science Tells Us About Yellow Tea,"On the Puer forum I wrote the following article on Yellow tea (and how it compares in productions methods to Puer), and I am reproducing it here for all to see. 

This post is a summary of the following two scientific papers: 1) Xu, et. al., ""Yellow tea (Camellia sinensis L.), a promising Chinese tea: Processing, chemical constituents and health benefits,"" Food Research International 107 (2018), 567–577; and 2) Wei, et. al., ""The profile of dynamic changes in yellow tea quality and chemical composition during yellowing process,"" LWT - Food Science and Technology 139 (2021), 110792. 

Note that the main production steps of Yellow tea are withering--pan frying--""sealed yellowing""--drying. Sealed yellowing is where the tea is piled and covered with a cloth, or is wrapped tightly in paper. Certain types of yellow teas will include rolling before the yellowing or will have multiple steps of yellowing in between drying steps. 

Major points:

1) The kill-green step (""shaqing"") in which the tea is pan-fried in order to destroy endogenous polyphenol oxidase (PPO, the enzyme that causes oxidation) is performed to completion like in green teas (although it may be performed differently in some cases, i.e. longer at a lower temperature) and **unlike** in Puer in which some PPO will remain in the plant cells. 

2) The yellowing stage can be done in two different ways, ""wet"" and ""dry"" based on whether or not any drying has been done before the yellowing. Often yellow teas will include a short ""wet"" yellowing followed by baking and then by a much longer ""dry"" yellowing. Frequently the total amount of yellowing can approach 3 or 4 days, but performed in intervals. 

3) Oxidation is the primary chemical change that occurs during the yellowing stage. However, since there is no endogenous PPO left to perform that oxidation, the reaction requires an exogenous source of PPO. This is provided by a variety of microbial activity that thrives in the warm and wet yellowing environment.

4) Due to the microbial activity mentioned in #3, Yellow tea can be considered microbially fermented. This means that the yellowing processes is very similar in kind to the ""wet piling"" process used to make Shu Puer and other Heicha. The main difference of course is that for Shu puer, the process is done for a far longer period of time and water is added. Note that if the yellowing process is extended for a very long time, the tea will start to turn dark brown--showing again that oxidation is the key activity--albeit oxidation aided by exogenous microbes. Another interesting clue is that Yellow tea develops a high level of betaine after yellowing--exactly what happens to shu puer as well. 

5) For those concerned with health effects, Yellow tea has been shown to carry a similarly high level of polyphenols (catechins) as with Green tea, but with differing amounts of each catechin (More ECG and less ECGC in comparison to Green). Yellow tea has higher total catechins compared to white tea, which shows how much more oxidized white tea actually is, given that the latter does not undergo kill-green. Yellow tea has been shown to be extremely effective at promoting, liver, stomach, and cardiac health and has the highest levels of **L-theanine** of all six tea categories. 

Conclusion: I at first thought that Yellow tea could be considered similar to Sheng puer in production method. This was incorrect as Yellow tea is made with a complete kill-green phase. It is in fact more similar to Shu puer in that both are microbially fermented.",1610423241

tea,Elvthee,kv6ctc,Wanting to try puerh tea,"Hello! For a while I've been getting into tea and teaware and I have been enjoying various green and black teas (not a big oolong fan atm). I'm now finding myself more and more attracted by the idea of trying Puerh tea, specifically Sheng since the ripe puerh sounds a bit too funky... 

I'm looking at getting either somethinh from teamania (Switzerland) or Nannoushan (Germany). I know that these aren't the usual recommendations, but it's waaay to expensive for me to get tea direct from China with import fees, shipping and tax. 

What are some good looking cakes from the two websites? Have you tried any? And is it ok to go for a cheaper cake in the beginning? I've been looking at the autumn bee cake from teamania and it's not too expensive. 

What about brewing? I have a temperature variable kettle and an 180 mL easy gaiwan + 180 mL glass teapot I can use. Currently no other tools and my parents' scale only does 5 g intervals (ik wtf). I've been trying some gongfu brewing but I just eyeball the amount of tea",1610383342

I don’t want to wait a month for something to ship though, so are there some websites that still have nice ones but are based closer to the west? Unfortunately Yunnan US is mostly sold out at the moment",1610382260

That said, I would like to expand my horizons and try some unflavored teas from other vendors.  I see that Yunan Sourcing is highly recommended, but they carry so many options for black teas, I am at a loss as to where to start. Unfortunately, they don't offer any sample packs, and lots of their teas are sold out, making it even harder to decide.

  
Can anyone recommend some unflavored black teas that are in stock (100g size) to get me started?",1610379873

However at one point he put lamp oil into the teapot (tears in my eyes while typing this) and it now just stinks of the lamp oil. I have looked online to see if I can remove the smell by submerging it in boiling water and leaving it for 12 hours everyday in hopes of extracting out the oil / odour. Do you think this will work or should give up now and keep it as an ornament?",1610359667

tea,likeframingdoves,kuuyzu,Found white flakes in a tea bag?,"I ripped open a couple of earl grey tea bags (to make concentrated earl grey) and as the contents of the last bag fell into the slow-cooker I noticed right before it dissolved some white crystal-like flakes. 

Opened another one and saw the same thing, after tasting one I'm pretty positive it's sugar with flavoring in it (maybe bergamot flavoring?)

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them? Or if it's harmful? Is this is a thing cheap tea manufactures do to add flavor? I got it as a gift and is most likely from TJ maxx so quality is questionable (the person who gifted it works at one).

The name on the box was The Secret Garden Organic Earl Grey Black Tea, if that rings a bell to anyone.

I tried googling it but nothing came up and of course I figure reddit is the best place to refer to",1610338563

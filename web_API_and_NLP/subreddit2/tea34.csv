I've always read about the great benefits of real herbal tea (not that vending machine stuff), and I've always wanted to enjoy tea. My problem is that I've got chronic migraines that are tied to my stomach. If my stomach is unhappy, I get migraines and vice versa. My other problem is that tea greatly upsets my stomach. 

My mother is a tea drinker and I tried green tea. That was horrible on my system, so I thought I would dilute the taste. I quit after I hit 1 part green tea and 25 parts water. At 4% tea, the taste was either too strong and set my stomach off, or (to me) tasted bad. 

My question: is there a tea out there that is SUPER basic/easy? I don't know if they have teas for kids, but most of my Google searches tell me to try specifics of green/black tea and I'm just rather confused as there are so many teas out there and everybody has different opinions as to what a beginner is.

It was nice; quite approachable as young sheng goes, probably mellower due to the roasting process.  It tasted a good bit like bamboo too, with some other range like floral tones, dried fruit, and a touch of lemon.  Bitterness and astringency were even lower than for young sheng ""designed"" to be approachable, making me wonder how this would change further with age.  It didn't match the refinement, intensity, and complexity of good sheng but it was pleasant, and for novelty really interesting to experience.

Then I made 3 orders from MeiLeaf. 2 hours ago I did another big order full of samples from Taiwan Tea Crafts. I did the math. I ordered 33 different teas between 3g (1 white tea only) and 250g (went all in with Dong Ding and I've never even had one but I fell in love with Taiwanese Oolongs that I tried for first time this week).

I have 9 tins that can store 500g tea (3 of them can store up to 1kg). But 30 of these 33 teas are 25 or 50g (4-5x10g). The ones from Taiwan Tea Craft are not ziplocs I think and some of the MeiLeaf samplers are also not ziplocs. I suppose I cannot put them unsealed in the same tin as thry will absorb aromas and a cross-contamination will happen for sure (I've heard that tea is like a sponge for smells).

What should I do? My shopping addiction caught me unprepared. I tried my first Taiwanese Oolong and I was so blown away that I couldn't stop myself of ordering and ordering. I feel bad now. 

How do you store samples and smaller pouches of tea? Do you leave it in the pouch? 1035g tea with my 50ml gaiwan is not that easy to consume fast. And my ADHD will make me open all of them to try 2 different teas every single day until I try all of them. I guess I should just buy 30 tins lol. But I can't find smaller ones. I've got 6 from Ikea thinking that a $2-3 tin will be small - well they are huge.

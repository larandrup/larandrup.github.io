tea,1Meter_long,km67da,Fukujirushi steeping temp?,"Do you use 70c - 75c/158f - 167f or below 70c/158f for fukamushi tea? I still dont seem to get this right, and have that thick mouth feel. I tried below 70c today, but i used long steeping time, so idk if i should reduce it and go for higher temp, or add more leaves and reduce steeping time.

I can tell my parameters, but i brew teas very differently than people here seem to brew.

I used two and half table spoons (not heaping) and about 350ml/11.8oz water and 3min 30sec.water temp was maybe 67c/152f.

I'm not going to change my way to do multiple steeps, but idk if i should use higher water temps, lower water temp, add more leaves etc. I have tried this tea many times, but i just cant seem to get it right. I can brew my other senchas just fine, except these fukamushi ones.",1609213068

Recently uncovered some tea “pucks” I bought during a trip to Shanghai a few years back.

The first is an aged white tea that I opened and sampled back in 2018. It’s been in its original packaging and two ziplock style bags since and stored in my 68F pantry. Does it still look ok to enjoy? Any particular tips in preparing this tea as it’s a lot of large compressed leaves and stems.

The second is raw up-erh. I don’t recall why I bought it originally since I don’t normally drink this style but it’s been in a vacuum sealed pouch stored in the same way as described above. Similar questions about how to prepare this and what to expect.",1609204722

for anyone wondering i used a brand called main 105 and it was a medium roast coffee

on my first brew i did a flash steeping at around 180 degrees fahrenheit to be on the safe side, and i was suprised to find that the brew was sweet. it was a bit underwhelming though. it tasted more like a little sugar water and black coffee than anything. but the next infusion was very different.

i did my second infusion as a flash steep at a full boil. after i tried it i can finally say im a coffee fan. it had the nice body and scent of coffee with that sweetness staying around and even tasted lemony somehow at the end.

I got a nice bamboo tea tray as a christmas gift and I've been over the moon about it, but I'm still not quite sure how to go about taking care of it. It is the kind where you have a plastic box inside where the water goes. 

Some people say the tray should be washed and dried after each use, but since so far I've been using it several times a day it feels a bit funny to wash and dry it after every use. Is it enough if I do this at the end of the day when I know I won't be using it anymore that day? 

I got the tray two or three weeks ago and I think some parts have maybe already turned a bit darker because of the tannins of the tea (I assume). Is this a sign I haven't taken good enough care of the tray or is it something that happens over time no matter what you do? Also, some people say you should oil the tray. Is this necessary, and if so, how often should I oil it and what kind of oil would you recommend? Is there anything else to know about maintenance of the tray?

Green tea, black tea, and oolong. I even learned how to do Gong Fu brewing and all that, but now I'm seeing some people go crazy with matcha, so I want to try it. 

A few days ago I stopped by a Starbucks and ordered a matcha latte. I know, it's nowhere near close to the real thing, but that taste... it tasted like fish and cabbage. I had this happen with a Japanese Sencha that I made early on in my tea journey, and oh my God. That fishy and cabbage taste makes me gag so bad, so now I'm wondering if that's maybe somewhat close to what matcha tastes like? I cannot believe this kind of taste could possibly come from a few leaves, and I know for a fact it wasn't a spoiled beverage from Starbucks because I managed to recreate that taste when I made Japanese Sencha for the first time. I know now how to make it, and it's hard to get it right, but when I do it tastes great.

I am kind of new to tea world. I want to buy myself my first gaiwan and a set of 2-4 cups. I was browsing various vendors online, but almost all teaware I found was aesthetically boring or simply not pretty to me.

## Ancient Chinese porcelain

The only exception was porcelain at [The Essence of Tea](https://essenceoftea.com/collections/porcelain-teacups). I love their minimalistic hand painted Asian ornamentation. It's beautiful to me. I love this kind of raw, natural but at the same time pretty and sensitive aesthetics that's missing from almost all modern design.

## Price tag

The only problem are the prices - all of their teaware is very expensive. It seems to me it's so expensive, because they are faithful replicas of ancient porcelain from China. I don't know anything about ancient China porcelain and I don't care if something is an antique or not. So paying extra just because it's a faithful replica, is kind of waste of money in my case.

## Buy it cheaper?

*I wonder if you guys know some places, where I can buy something similar aesthetically, but for lower price? I would prefer it to be good quality and long lasting too.*

It doesn't have to be exactly the same, or even Chinese style. I don't know a lot about ancient Asian porcelain. Maybe I would like some Japanese or Vietnamese ornamentation too. I trust your judgement.",1609047237

Now, I admit I am biased against cinnamon a bit, but what is up with the artificial sweetener overload?! Nowhere on the box, website, or reviews does it mention that this tea is pre-sweetened. I even tried it as iced tea but it still had that fake sweet flavor.

Does anyone else feel this way? I had 4 other people try it here and they weren't big fans either but all the online reviews just loved it.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I'm going to try mixing my own orange &amp; cinnamon tea now.",1609044028
tea,HPA_Axis,kkvzgy,Can someone describe the taste/qualities of white tea relative to green tea for me?,"TL; DR: What is white tea like? How does it compare to green tea? 

Hello r/tea! This is my first post here after using tea as a distraction, then becoming a casual tea drinker, to becoming a little more of a tea fanatic.

I'm wanting to know more about the flavor profile, etc of white tea versus green tea. I enjoy green tea a lot, but I've found it very hard to find white tea in a variety of locations where I live and decaffeinated white tea nearly impossible, even online (I drink obscene amounts of liquids in general and have two medical reasons to avoid caffeine).

I would hate to waste money on something that will probably have to be shipped to me only to not like it, not to mention that it's hard to find a way to get a small quantity of it efficiently.

I'm waiting for my (replacement Christmas present) first teapot to come to me, so I wanted to do some research about white tea before delving deeper into loose tea. I'd appreciate any suggestions or recommendations!",1609038643

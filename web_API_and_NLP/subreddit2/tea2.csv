How to make a teaboy timer with a microwave oven and a string.... 

I often forget to get my tea after the timer signal and then I have to make a new cup of tea because it gets to strong.

I was planning to build a digital teaboy that on timer,  lift up the tea from the cup.

But then I did an experiment with my digital micro oven that worked great.

I put my tea cup on the edge of the round plate in the micro that rotate and the put a long string on the teabag. 

I then made a lid over the cup so that it had a hole in the middle and put the teabag hanging down and put the cup at the inner edge of the round plate.

Then I pulled the string out of the micro until the teabag was just under the lidhole and over the water in the cup.

Then I closed the door so that the string was stuck in the door.

Then I adjusted the timer and effect so that the teabag was going up and down in the cup, 

as the cup  rotated,  in the micro wave oven, my favorit 4 minuts and when the time stopped the cup stopped at the inner part of the micro oven where the teabag was hanging over the water.

So now I never forget the tea to get to strong.

I now use a high thermos cup so even if I forget  my tea for a period the tea will still be hot in the micro oven when I go and get it.

I made some videos on the process.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnblraThxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnblraThxg)

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is a great idea for people who do not want to waste tea.

So what do you think about the idea.

Did you try it?

tea,feels_old,lrf971,Holy smokes cold brewed green tea is amazing,"I was having a lot of trouble brewing a good cup of green tea warm, but I guess part of that is I just don't like the astringency that most have, which doesn't necessarily go away even when messing with different variables in gongfu brews.

tea,dohrey,lr8vhb,Crowd sourcing a comprehensive guide to tea freshness and when to consume tea at its best,"For people who buy higher end teas I think it is only natural to want to consume that tea (that you've spent hard earned money on) when it is at its absolute best. But I've never seen an exhaustive guide on how this applies to different tea types (at best, a guide might examine the broad categories of tea and tell you their maximum storage times, but won't take into account very specific types). So I'm hoping others can input into this guide I've made based on my experience and what I've read in various places to create a crowd sourced guide and fill in the blanks (indicated by question marks) where I haven't seen much guidance, add in more categories you think I've missed and correct me if you think I'm wrong. But my ideas are below. I have also put in some notes on proper storage at the bottom.

**Green tea**

- *Chinese, Japanese and Korean green tea*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.

**Yellow tea**

- *Huangshan yellow tea*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1.5 years if stored properly.
- *Yunnan yellow tea*: ???

**Oolong tea**

- *Lightly oxidised and unroasted oolong (e.g. Taiwanese high mountain and tie guan yin)*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 6 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Highly oxidised but unroasted oolong (e.g. certain Taiwanese and Indian/Nepalese oolongs)*: From personal experience I find they are best consumed anytime within 1 year of harvest, but can be potentially ok for up to 2 years.
- *Medium roasted oolongs (e.g. some Taiwanese, Dancong oolong, and very light Wuyi oolongs)*: Best to wait for at least a month or so after harvest for roast flavours to dissipate a bit. Best consumed within 1 year of harvest to maintain floral notes. 
- *Highly roasted oolongs (e.g. most Wuyi oolongs)*: Generally considered best to wait for 6 months to a year after harvest for roast flavours to dissipate a bit. Generally good for a few years.

*Footnote*: some people like aged oolongs (stored cool and dry). Seems general consensus is lightly oxidised oolongs don't age well, and roasted oolongs age better. Probably takes about 10 years for noticeable aged flavours to come through.

**Black tea**

- *First flush Darjeelings (and probably other very heavily wilted/lightly oxidised black teas)*: Best consumed ASAP after harvest. Ideally consumed within 9 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Second flush Darjeelings/Nilgiri teas*: Best consumed within a year of harvest. Probably generally ok for up to 1.5-2 years.
- *Autumn flush Darjeelings/Assams/other heavily oxidised and malty Indian/Nepalese/Sri Lankan/African teas*: I find it is best for these to rest for 1-2 months before consuming to allow flavours to come together. Generally ok to consume for at least 2 years.
- *Delicate/floral Chinese black teas (e.g. Jin Jun Mei and other Fujian teas) and Taiwanese black teas*: Best consumed 1-2 months after harvest to let overly ""fresh"" flavours dissipate a bit. Ideally consumed within 9 months. Can be potentially ok for up to 1 year if stored properly.
- *Robust Chinese black teas (e.g. in particular dian hongs)*: Best consumed c.6 months after harvest to allow resting and flavours to come together. Generally ok to consume for at least 2 years.
- *Sun dried black teas (shian hong) and black teas made from puerh varietals*: Best consumed 1-3 years after harvest to allow flavours to develop. Whether longer term aging would be beneficial seems debatable.
- *Japanese black teas*: ???

**White tea**

- *Silver needle and bai mu dan*: Up to personal preference. Consumed within 6 months to a year of harvest the tea will be more floral and fresh. After that, the tea will start to age and develop more oxidised flavours. No real maximum aging time as long as the tea is stored properly.
- *Lower grade white tea (shou mei, gong mei)*: probably best aged for at least a few years. Aging has real effect after 3-5 years. No real maximum aging time as long as the tea is stored properly.

**Puerh tea/Hei cha**

- *Raw puerh*: Some is designed to be drunk young and should be consumed within 18 months to keep ""fresh"" flavours. Most raw puerh benefits from aging. Generally considered to have developed some aged character after 5-7 years depending on storage conditions. 
- *Ripe puerh*: Generally best to wait a year after production for fermentation tastes to dissipate. Aging has some effect but not as big as raw puerh. Maximum storage time (where aging may have beneficial effects) debatable but probably at least 10 years.
- *Other hei cha*: ???

**Notes on storage**

For basically all teas the keys to good storage are: 

(1) Avoid light. Keep the tea in a dark place and opaque packaging.

(2) Avoid humidity. If you live in a humid area putting dessicant packs in your tea containers is probably a good idea.

(3) Avoid too much heat. A relatively cool place is best, and don't keep it near a heater or cooker. Some will recommend keeping green teas and greener oolongs in the fridge. I think it is debatable how beneficial this is (given it can encourage condensation on the tea) if you don't live somewhere super hot.

(4) Avoid strong smells. Tea will soak up smells very easily, so sealed packaging away from strong smells like cleaning products, spices, perfumes etc is best.

(5) Avoid oxygen. Keeping teas in a sealed airtight container without much air space will be fine for most teas. For green teas and light oolongs you could consider vacuum packing or using oxygen absorbers for optimal storage.

The main exception to this is puerh where some airflow and humidity is good for storage. How much exactly is a hugely controversial and detailed topic!",1614159764

tea,Flowerstotea,lq0uz1,Is a French press good for making tea?,"Hello tea lovers, 

Recently I had tea at a cafe and they used a French press (I’d only ever seen them used for coffee before).

I’ve been thinking about getting one. Has anyone liked or disliked using a French press for loose leaf tea?

Thanks!",1614030287
tea,dohrey,lq0rwb,How long after harvest is black tea at its best?,"There seems to be a lot of conflicting information out there on when black tea is best to drink after its harvested. 

It seems clear very light black teas like Darjeelings should be treated like green teas and basically consumed ASAP after harvest, but for others it's not so clear it seems. E.g. Yunnan Sourcing seems to suggest Yunnan black teas are best at least 6 months to a year after harvest, but then others seem to think black teas basically just stay the same for around 2-3 years after harvest and then start to decline. Some other black teas seem to be specifically designed to be aged (e.g. compressed black teas).

What's your experience around this? Have any of you experimented tasting teas at different periods after harvest and found anything interesting?

I am basically debating whether or not to hold off on buying some black tea from Yunnan Sourcing until after the spring harvest when I can get 2021 teas, or just buying 2020 harvested teas now.",1614030074

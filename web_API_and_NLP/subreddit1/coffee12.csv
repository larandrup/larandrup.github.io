Coffee,rscarson,lguzb2,Looking for my dream coffee machine,"I have been trying to find a machine that fits my (admittedly extensive) wishlist.

I would like it to have:

- Burr adjustable burr grinder
- Bean hopper that can dose out for a single brew so I don't have to refill it each time
- Able to brew a single cup of variable sizes up to 12oz, or a whole pot
- Can be plumbed into the water supply
- Easy cleaning/maintenance

I know I likely cannot afford whatever it will be for a long time, but I want something to aspire to. 

Closest I have found is the Miele CM5300, but I honestly could do without a milk frother I think; extra maintenance and cost I'm not certain I would use, it also cannot that I can find be plumbed in. Additionally, 12oz is pretty long for a long coffee and I doubt how good it would perform at that level of dillution.",1612968012

Ex-barista (7 years part-time) - A quality I highly appreciate in a barista is cleanliness. The worst thing is to work side by side with someone who leaves a trail of milk, equipment and grinds everywhere. It is also quite tough to create good and consistent coffee in a messy battlestation...!

Coffee,Worthasecondchance,lgu1ac,Long time barista looking to start making coffee at home,"Bit of context before I get into it - I've been a barista for about 7 or 8 years now, and in that time have mostly been working with commercial machines. Even though I have been *making* coffee for a long time (and certainly drinking a whole heap along the way), I don't think I've necessarily developed my knowledge on the depth of coffee as much as I should or could have. Even though I'm somewhat decent at my job, and am definitely an efficient and well experienced barista, I'd bet that 99% of the average home coffee enthusiast knows more about the different types of coffee preparation/flavours than I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My taste has evolved from drinking single shot 16oz caramel iced lattes when I first started working at Maccas, to drinking about 4 or 5 piccolos a day (or maybe a couple triple shot 8oz iced lattes on a hot day). I really want to get into the world of drinking black coffee (for both health and flavour appreciation reasons), but am struggling to find the best way to go about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst we do do cold drip and batch brew at the cafe I currently work at (and of course, long blacks), I usually don't have time to sit and sip a coffee while I'm on shift, so I'm looking for advice on how to start enjoying black coffee using home preparation methods rather than with a commercial machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question/s then becomes - What is the ""best"" way to start delving into the craft of preparing black coffee at home? I have dabbled in using a french press and moka pot as they seem to be the most commonly suggested, but am curious about V60s, aeropresses and chemex/pourover methods as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the second thing is, before going out and getting an espresso machine for the home (thinking of the Rancilio Silvia or La Marzocco Linea Mini down the line), would it be worth investing in a quality grinder first? My thinking is that I can use it to grind beans for preparing black coffee, and once I acquire an espresso machine, it can also be used for that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to know what you guys think, and open to any suggestions and guidance on what preparation would be best to start with, what beans to go for, or anything else!",1612965105

Coffee,hamzez,lgalne,1Zpresso JX-Pro Or Kinu M47 Phoenix?,"I’ve been recently dwelling into the coffee world and I’ve become more and more happy making a good cup of coffee. I mostly drink beans from a local shop in the morning and later switch to decaff. When I switched from instant coffee to an AeroPress my god the difference in taste was huge. I recently started grinding my own beans as well, but I’ve only been using an electric blade grinder since that was the cheapest option available. I didn’t realize how inconsistent my grind would be with a blade grinder, so my cup was different every time. While it was still a good cup (huge upgrade from instant coffee) I’ve been looking into investing into a good quality hand grinder that will last me for years. I’ve been looking around for a while and I just can’t seem to make up my mind on which one to get. Right now I’m torn between Kinu M47 Phoenix and the 1Zpresso JX-Pro. I was about to purchase a comandante c40 mk3 that got on sale for 221 euros but quickly got out of stock and now its back to 270 euro full price. I was also about to get an aergrind by knock but with the shipping costs the price bumps up to similar of the Kinu and the Jx-pro I then looked at the Timemore Slim but that quickly got out of stock as well so most of the good grinders at the 120euro price range aren’t going to be on stock anytime soon. Which is why I’ve been looking into the Kinum47 and the Jx-pro I’ve been hesitant to click on the order button because for me it is still A LOT of money to spend for a student but might have to be an investment, I’m going to make later on so why not make a good investment now with no regrets later?

Both the Kinu and the JX-pro seems to be well received in the community and both have great positives. I can get the kinum47 for 219euros and the Jx-pro for 199 right now that’s the lowest I can find them at a place that ships within eu (I live in DK so I can’t purchase anything overseas or it will get way too expensive) 

I’m planning to grind for AeroPress, French press and the V60 (which I ordered a few days ago I’m interested to see how that turns out) I don’t have the budget to make an espresso investment.

I like a grinder with decent capacity 25g+ and both of these seem very sturdy and durable which I quite like but I’d like to also have a grinder that is more on the simpler side one that doesn’t require too much maintenance and not finicky if that makes sense and one that doesn’t take ages to use since I mostly would be using it for my morning coffee. 

What do you guys think? Should I wait it out and just keep sticking to my blade grinder for the time being or should I make the investment and get either the Kinum47 or the JX-pro? Or would you think it’s not worth spending that amount of money and just wait until something like the Timemore Slim gets back into store? Or do you have better suggestions for grinders that is EU based?",1612897240

Coffee,Acavia8,lg5gyg,Swiss-Water decaffeination process,"I am thinking about getting some decaf coffee, so I am reading about how it is made.  From what I read, the Swiss Water Process has two parts:  

1) it runs fresh, boiled runs water through some green coffee beans, and that water goes through some charcoal filters designed to only take the caffeine out of the water.   I assume those coffee beans are thrown away or used for something else.

2) That water, which has all coffee compounds, sans caffeine, is then run through the actual coffee beans that will be sold as decaffeinated.   Since the water has all  green coffee bean extractable compounds, except caffeine, in it, it will tend to only extract caffeine, from the targeted beans.

I printed out an excel sheet, with the following fields, that i filled up with each cup i made, including slight variations - bean, grind coarseness, amount of grind, water temp, amount of water, brew time, along with a few checkbox fields like preheat french press, stir before, stir after, beans to water / water to beans etc, and finally comments. All variables were tested, except for the beans, as i used different types each time, still on the hunt for the perfect bean, my all time fav was discontinued before i ever got a chance to grind my own. 

**After around a 100 cups, I found the following golden formula:** 

Grounds - 28g post grind, a tad bit finer than the regular french grind. 

Water - 350ml, 70 degrees C (158 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Method - beans ground, added to french press, water added to the grounds, as soon as all the water is in, its stirred, and then left for around 5-7 minutes. Pressed and poured. 

This temperature works especially for me because i cant stand having something so hot that i cant drink it immediately. and i love gulping the first sip ASAP once its in the cup. 

**Streamlining the process** \- Charting was cool and you feel like a scientist but im done, i got the formula for alchemy and now im just making gold. Grounds are done by a push of a button, found the exact time needed to get 28g of my grounds at the 24 setting on the baratza - 10.6 seconds. boiling water is added to about 50 ml of room temp water, which instantly creates a 70 degree mix, so no more thermometers. water levels are all marked on the press, so no more estimates either.",1612873417

Previously people think making coffee is a hectic task but now the days are gone because with the help of an automatic coffee machine one can easily prepare the coffee. The coffee is not a drink that can be kept for hours as its taste gets bitter with time. So, fresh coffee is only preferred by all the people.

The automatic coffee machine has made it easier for people to enjoy the freshness of coffee with the help of a grinder.

I've just put it through its second descaling. Had no problems after the first descaling, simple, if lengthy, process and coffee was fine straight after.

Whilst the grinder was running I turned it clockwise, to make the ground coffee finer, so a little less water got through and I got a stronger espresso.

Coffee,fogna_bologna,lg13u8,V60 brew bed question,"I was looking up different recipes to brew using my V60.  2 videos I came across had 2 different brew bed methods, I tried both and liked them but I wanted to hear your thoughts on the difference.  The first video was the Hoffman method, no surprise.  He says to keep a flat brew bed for an even extraction.  The other was the Onyx coffee method where they suggest a hard central pour to create a cone within the contour of the V60 which would use its conical shape and grooves the way it was intended, thus creating an even extraction.

Thoughts? do you think the more even extraction would come from the flat brew bed method or the conical method? I'm interested in what you have to say!",1612871128

Coffee,Dull-Goal7655,lfza0u,Need advice on which machine to get for high footfall cafe.,"Hi guys, later in the year I will be opening a high footfall (hopefully!) specialty coffee shop and I’m currently deciding on which machine from below would be best to get. Lets just say, for the sake of this question, that they all have reliable local technical support. Let me know your thoughts on any positives and negatives of the following machines. Are they all fairly barista friendly? Correct me if I’m wrong but I decided against machines like slayers/SR Opera as they are overly complex for some baristas. Would the following all be great options?

1 - Kees Van Der Westen Spirit

2 - Synesso MVP hydra

3 - San Remo Cafe Racer

4 - La Marzocco KB90

Coffee,cum_bandit,lfxg85,Why is the Lido 3 considered a good grinder?,"I got tricked into buying this piece of shit over two years ago and have begrudgingly used it that entire time since I don't feel like spending another $200 on one of OE's superior competitors. I genuinely do not understand how people can say that this is a good grinder and recommend it to others when alternatives exist. 

The construction is awful, with the folding handle constantly folding in on itself during grinding, and the threads in the ring stack getting filled with coffee particulates and being a pain to clean. 

Then the actual grind quality is about on par with a cheap $20 ceramic burr grinder. Mine came from the factory misaligned and I have never been able to successfully align it despite following OE's videos on realignment exactly. Just 10 minutes ago I inverted it, loosened the four screws attaching the burr ring to the hopper, removed the bottom shaft screw to allow the burr to rotate freely, exactly as shown by the designer, and turned the handle to ""align"" the burrs. Screwed everything back together, and I'm getting the burrs locked at -3 ticks and audible burr rub all the way to up 4 ticks. 

I wondered for a while whether I had received a fake or something, but I doubt that anyone would go to the trouble to fake a product this bad. People who actually shill this thing on here, what do you actually like about it?",1612856422

I probably drink about 500ml of coffee in a given day, and I was eyeing the Bonavita 1900 series. From what I can tell, it seems to be a great machine with proper brewing temperatures, a pre infusion feature, and a shower head. I’m wondering, is it possible to produce coffee in these auto brewers that are just as good of quality as a manual pour over, assuming you have good technique with the latter? I know that cheap drip coffee machines can produce pretty underwhelming coffee due to the numerous issues while brewing, but I’m curious if the more quality, modern auto brewers have come far enough that they can compete with manual methods",1612831416

It is a tubular design, but looking inside shows it's a single hole wand, however it has a second hole further up on the side of the tube (I think it's called a Venturi hole??) which introduces air I don't want. 

My question is: Could I change this for a Rancilio Silvia wand?

Or, short of that, could I cover the home up somehow?

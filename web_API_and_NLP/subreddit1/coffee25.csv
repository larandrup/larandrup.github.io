Coffee,Lognipo,kz7foe,Grind size vs quantity,"Good morning!

Someone was kind enough to get me the Baratza Encore I wanted for Christmas, and now that I have some control over my grind size, I was wondering how to use this to my advantage.

I love to drink coffee over long periods, but I am fairly caffeine sensitive, and alas, this year I seem to have also developed a tendency for heartburn related to coffee.  As much as I like the bolder flavors of coffee, I need to brew it weaker than I used to.  So with a blade grinder, and also so far with the Encore, I have been brewing about 8 cups to 3 very slightly heaped tablespoons, and this allows me to drink the entire pot with no caffeine issues and no heartburn.

That said, if I want to play around with adjusting the strength of the coffee, would I be better off adjusting the grind or adjusting the amount?  Is there a trick to this?  Is there something grinding finer will do for me which adding extra coffee will not, and vice versa?",1610894000

Coffee,iHoffs,kz6a83,"Sette 270Wi, Eureka Specialita or other for variety-ish (?) grinding"," I have been looking at something higher end to upgrade from my cheap-ish manual hario grinder and would like to just get a single machine. Currently I am mostly using v60 and aeropress but I would like to get a espresso machine (Rancilio Silvia or something) in the future which would be main method at that point. So I would like a grinder that could accommodate for something like v60/aeropress grind but would also be capable of espresso grind.

I've seen a lot of talk about ""dialing in"" being an issue or waste, but since I don't expect to be switching a lot from v60 to espresso I feel like that shouldn't be an issue. What I am just looking really is a grinder that can do both.

First I was looking at Sette 270Wi, but there are tons of people saying that it can't really do anything besides espresso (even though the manufacturer claims 3 (good) for manual and 5 (exceptional) for espresso).

Then I found that Eureka Specialita sells for roughly the same here and they claim to be able to do all the way from French to espresso which sounds great.

Lastly I saw a lot of recommendations for Niche Zero, but being in EU and with current Brexit situation on their page (+ long wait time) I feel like this is not really an option as they do not have any resellers.

So bottom line, I am looking for something that I could get now and would not have an issue transitioning from coarser (french press, V60, aeropress) to espresso in the future.

Thanks for any comments.",1610889440
Coffee,kevinlar,kz4mfa,Confused about V60 and bitterness,"I have been making V60 now for a couple of months, I roughly follow Hoffman's method - 18g coffee to 300g water, pouring over a total time of 1:45 inc a 45s bloom. I was reasonably happy with the cups even though I was getting something like a 5 min drawdown time, which seems to be pretty long from what I've read.

I have just recently upgraded from a Hario mini mill to a Comandante C40. First impression - wow! the Comandante grinds so much more consistently - I didn't even realise how inconsistent my old grinder was. I have made 2 cups now with the new grinder, at 20 clicks and 25. I'm getting a much faster drawdown, 3-3:30 and the grinds are noticeably coarser at these settings (especially 25 clicks) than what I was using with the previous grinder. What I've noticed though, is that the cup tastes slightly bitter, and I've lost the sweetness that I had before.

Why would this be the case? My understanding is that a coarser grind (with way less fines) and a faster drawdown should lead to LESS extraction, which I thought was meant to make things more acidic rather than more bitter.

The cups I am getting with the new grinder are undoubtedly cleaner than before, and I'm really looking forward to getting things dialed in as I just KNOW that it's going to taste great when I do.",1610881831

I felt so affirmed by this recent video from James Hoffmann about percolation vs immersion [(linked here)](https://youtu.be/09fNvoQMlGw) \- I've tried so hard with so many other brewing methods, but the Aeropress inverted method is simply the best quality coffee one can achieve when home brewing - in every single category.

* Do you like a french press? The Aeropress inverted method lets you steep just as long as you would with the french press.
* Do you like a clear cup? Use the paper filters and it's just as clear as a paper-filtered pour over.
* Do you like an easy cleanup? You press out the puck, rinse, and you're done.
* Do you like a full pot of coffee in the morning? Use more grounds, dilute with semi-boiling water, press into a separate carafe, and the little thing makes an entire pot of pseudo americano on its own!
* Minimizing waste? Order a metal filter and it's zero waste.

I've tried so many methods:

* Moka pot can make some good coffee, but it's a bit fickle and scary. It's nice to get that high concentration though.
* Perhaps I just lack the skill, but *pour overs are too easy to mess up*. I've spent weeks with a timer, a scale, and all different grinds and roasts from a friend that worked at a nice coffee shop, and I can't seem to consistently get coffee I really love. V60, chemex, kalita cup, paper and metal filters, perfect roast, perfect grind, perfect ratios, whatever I do is just not good enough.
* I *love* espresso, but I don't want to spend &gt;$500 on machine with high enough pressure.
* French press is alright, but I don't want a centimeter of mud at the bottom of my mug.

So basically, because this brewer retains more water and slows down drip rate, allowing more time for brewing than the regular v60 brewer.

The resulting cup was quite good. It was certainly less bitter than usual, but wasn't as sweet as JH's French Press/cupping technique. I shall try tweaking the grind, so get the similar results as cupping/FP.

Sometimes certain tastes, smells, or rituals remind you of good times or happy places. It doesn't necessarily have to be the best method, the best roast, or the best brew, but it still is drinkable and makes you feel all warm inside.

For me, it's brewing percolator coffee on the stove in an old-school glass top, stainless steel basket percolator. It reminds me of Christmas mornings at my parents' house on the lake, and waking up to the sound and smell of coffee perking and the snow outside.

Even if it doesn't always make the most consistent brew, or the best-tasting, I still love to drink it this way despite having other methods like a French Press, cveze, pour over...

Coffee,dxong,kyk5s8,Rancilio Silvia pressure problem?,"Hi everyone,

I just moved and started unpacking my Rancilio Silvia E 2020, which I bought during first wave lock down.

Now today when started it up, I  noticed the water coming out too quickly. I also noticed slight ""leak"" like a small string of water spewing out on the side. However I tried adjusting grinding on Niche Zero because I had recalibrated it hoping that would be the problem.

However the water is just flossing out. I've never experienced it before, leading me to think there is a problem with the pressure valve? Rancilio Silvia E 2020.

I finally managed to remove the spout and place the Pressure gauge. See video on how it is. It kinda stays on 9 bar but its leaking. Is this normal?

What is going? I can't identify the problem.

When I first turned it on, I usually let 300ml water through on both grouphead and steam wand. I let water through steam wand a couple of seconds, then closing the tap again. However I actually forgot to turn off the water pump for the hot water during the whole 300ml water pouring. Could this lead to malfunctioning?

Please help is needed.

She tried some decent Arabica I use for myself and didn’t like it so I went for a 50/50 arabica robusta blend which she absolutely hated.

Coffee,heavypingpong,kyfkxw,What manual grinder should I get for french press,"I'm an avid fan of french press coffee, since the results can be so great with relatively little effort. However I recently decided that I want to up my game with a manual grinder (due to space constraints).

What grinder should I look at with a budget of around 100-130 EUR? It would be nice if the thing grinds relatively fast, but I don't know if my budget allows for. Minimum capacity of 20-30 grams is preferable.

From what I understand, I can easilly go overboard with more expensive grinders that mainly differentiate themselves by being good with finer grinds.",1610787489

Coffee,AsianMustache,kyepmo,Some interesting observations from filtering cold brew,"My coldbrew is concentrated and needs dilution with water. 

When filtering the concentrate from the grounds in a paper filter i find that i cant do a pourover with room temp water several times with the resulting liquid still being quite concentrated. 

Normally i do 2 passes with a pourover with the first being the most concentrated and the second pass requiring a 50:50 ratio with water:concentrate. 

I tried pouring a third time and drank it as is and i gota say the brew is not only excellent but still quite concentrated. It could still be ok to 50:50 this in my opinion if you want a lighter brew. 

The interesting thing is this brew tastes complete and really full bodied despite being diluted 3 times. Imagine an espresso shot diluted with water at a 50:50 ratio. 

Im going to keep on diluting until i reach something that is undrinkable",1610783083

Coffee,lifeisreallygoodnow,ky9hif,Confused: 1:2 ratio doesn't make sense for a double shot,"We are told that for an espresso use the 1:2 ratio

When doing a double shot of coffe i have added enough ground coffee for a double

In this case for my 54 mm portafilter 18 grams

So my yield going on 1:2 should be

36 grams/ml out.

Sounds good right.

Yet we are told

A single shot is 1oz or 30ml/grams

A double shot is 2oz or 60ml/grams

Yet using the 1:2 ratio my yield ends up being 36 grams/ml on a double basket

That's less than 2oz (60ml/grams) which is the amount of a double shot.

So shouldn't the ratio of water be HIGHER i.e?

1:(X to get me 2oz/ 60ml) i.e 3.2

Something like

1:3.2

To get 2oz/60ml/grams?

OR are we always getting less than 2oz/60ml and the term DOUBLE only refers to the coffee ground and not the yield ratio",1610762470

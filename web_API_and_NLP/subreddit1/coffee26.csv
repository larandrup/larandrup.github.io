We had some Folgers Silk that's been hanging around for too long, so I used 67 grams of that with about 1010 grams of water.

I have a lot to learn, but this first pot is very promising.  This doesn't taste like any coffee I've ever had before.

I booked the water in a long-necked tea pot, then set it aside to let it cool for a few seconds.  I think I'm going to drill the lid so I can use a meat thermometer to get the right temperature.

First pour to cover the grounds, wait 45 seconds, then continue pouring to get a kilo of water.

This coffee is different, maybe a bit sweet, nutty, no ""bite"", not bitter...

I have not been able to locate the original recipe, but I have since added and subtracted from it to make my own version of it. The result of this recipe is a cup that is very fruity, light, and sometimes sour depending on the roast but never bitter. And, it’s a piece of cake!

18 grams medium-coarse grind (~30 on Baratza Encore)
80 grams “cold” water, initial pour
150 grams “hot” water, final pour
(230 grams water total)

1. Start with an inverted aeropress. Pour 18 grams coffee, shake to even out. 

2. Pour 80 grams of room-temperature (~75 F) water, stir with spoon to wet grounds evenly.

3. Set timer for 4 minutes. 

4. Bring additional water to 190 F. 

5. After the 4 minutes are up, pour 150 grams of 190 F water. Stir with spoon to wet grounds evenly. 

6. Set timer for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. 

7. After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, invert aeropress and purge. 

Enjoy!

The strange thing about this recipe is that it uses two different water temperatures, long brew times, and a coarse grind, all of which are unusual for the aeropress. Nevertheless, this is usually my go-to recipe.",1610735244

I went ahead and ordered a chemex, a hand grinder, a gooseneck electric kettle and some beans. While I wait for my supplies to arrive I have been researching brew methods and have a few questions. 

1. Should I absolutely be using a thermometer? Or is the water boiling a good enough indicator of temperature?
2. Should I return my electric kettle to the on position in between pours? Or is the temperature loss looked at as being negligible?
3. Is the freshness of brewed coffee important? Is it bad practice to brew in the morning and store in a thermos and then drink the coffee up to two hours later at work? 
4. What brewing method would you recommend? Should the method change depending on the beans? I have ordered a bag of Doma Chronic Super Dank and Airship Sumatra Kerinci Honey. 
5. What is the general consensus on metal pour over filters? From what I can tell the resistance is different from paper filters. I have ordered paper filters, but am curious if metal is a good option.

Coffee,Environmental_Cut257,kxtqjo,Breville Barista Express Noob,"Hello everyone, hope you guys can give me some feedback on why this is the case.

  
Just to give you some insight on how I use the machine.  I pull 18 grams of beans, weighted before grind and grind them into a cup. I use a tooth pick to fluff it up and break up the clumps and then transfer the ground coffee into my portafilter, (dual shot, single wall) with my funnel.   I then use the crema distribution/tamp tool to distribute first and then tamp down to the measurement of 7.5mm, which matches the razor tool.  I then use the razor tool anyway to make sure it's the right height.  I then purge the head and heat the glass, then carefully attach the portafilter and pull the shot, timing it and watching the pressure carefully.

&amp;#x200B;

I've watched alot of videos and done my research, I think I am doing things as well as possible now and I can get a great pressure and pull, (waiting on my naked/bottomless portafilter to really dial everything in).  

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I am having is that I have to set my grinder to a ridiculous level.  I almost always have to go to 4, this seems strange to me as nearly every video I've watched they start at 10 or 9 and maybe dial it to 8 max.   My extraction times aren't amazing either always falling short and the puck, while a nice form when dumped, seems a bit wetter than it should be, (not dripping or anything but just visually damp).  

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is the grind having to be that fine.   I opened the hop up, and there's heaps of shrapnel all around the rim, even whole beans.  Is my grinder busted, do I need to do some kind of configuration?  The grinder is set to 6 internally, which I believe is the default and should be fine for a brand new machine, (well going on to just under a month now).  Am I still doing something wrong?  I am more than happy to record myself going through all the motions.

  
I have tried 4 different coffees, 1 store bought and 3 premium, freshly roasted coffees and if I grind at anything over 5 on the dial the pressure is terrible, anything near 10 and it's sour and the pressure doesn't even enter the dark gauge.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have used the double wall single shot with no grinds to check the pressure and it seems fine.  I'm at a loss.  I am assuming its me who's in the wrong, but could it be that the grinder is faulty?  Is there any test I can do to find out?   I would hate to think I've gone to all this effort and the reason my coffee isn't getting to where I want it to be is a dodgy grinder.

&amp;#x200B;

Again I accept it could be me, but I'm not getting consistent shots and from what I read the grinder should be quite noticeably different with just 1 step up or down but if I go from a 4, (purge the grinder with 10 grams of beans), to a 6 the pressure doesn't really move negatively, but then sometimes it does....I really am at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I have to set my grinder to a ridiculously, normally way too fine setting to get decent pressure and I believe I am doing a good job of using the machine, how can I test my grinder to see if it's faulty or what could I be doing better.",1610714318

The quality of the espresso grind isn’t super important to me, definitely not as much as for pour over.

Has anyone done this? Can you speak on its viability? Do you think it’s worth it? I’ve read that grinding espresso can reduce the life of the Ode’s motor, but since I will use it sparingly I think I’m willing to do it. Any advice, thoughts, help? I am not finding much on the internet about this..

I've bought this bag of decent coffee.  When I've made it, it tasted well, but it was kind of sour. I've using less coffee grams per liter (14g/200ml), and brewing for a longer time (1:10) - as I've read on [this compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/). It did help, though the coffee was definitely not perfect.

I've checked on the seller's website - they say this coffee tastes best when made in espresso machine - I was in a hurry when I was ordering, so I didn't read the description carefully.

The coffee is a medium roast (The Barn, Huye Moutain  - Red Bourbon if that tells you anything).

Is it possible to brew it really well in aeropress, or should I just give it to someone who would be able to make more use of it?",1610679502

Coffee,redsunstar,kxjyfk,The majority of coffee drunk in the US is speciality coffee,"According to the Speciality Coffee Association:

""To put it simply, of all the cups of coffee consumed, 59% of those cups were specialty versus 41% non-specialty.""

Source: https://scanews.coffee/2017/11/29/2017-u-s-specialty-coffee-consumption-trends/

I came across this tidbit of information while trying to find out the largest producers of speciality coffee (in terms of country, which I did not find btw). Needless to say that I was a bit surprised. I'm not from he US and most of my knowledge about the coffee culture there comes articles from websites like Sprudge and obviously r/coffee. 

r/coffee in particular seems to hold the idea that most coffee in the US is bad, but that doesn't seem to be the case according to the SCA. 

However, there is one sentence that would have clarified this article:

""It is important to keep in mind that this data is based on the consumers’ perception of ‘specialty’. ""

But then again

""Extracting and interpreting data from the NCDT report, the SCA has developed an infographic that paints a picture of specialty coffee consumption in the U.S. over time.""

Meaning that the final numbers were not about simply consumer perception but that the SCA reconstructed a more accurate picture based on the National Coffee Drinking Trends's report. 

I am left even more confused. If anyone has a clearer picture about that report and the SCA's infographic, let us know.",1610674405
Coffee,ClientGlittering9996,kxizwm,Breville Barista Express - Cannot Dial In (2-4s blonding)," 

Hi everyone,

I would really appreciate some advice.

I have tried everything (Or so I think) to dial in my new Breville machine (3 weeks old) but have failed

I have gone through a systematic approach of adjusting Grind and dose to try and get the right yield and shot times.

I have used 3 different types of Beans from highly reputable local roasters (Single O and Triple Pick - all fresh 2-10 days old) - Note: started dialling in from scratch with each new bean type hoping it was the beans at first

I am weighing the dose and have played around with the 16-18g ranges in

I have adjusted the grind, both the internal and external Burr to try and get the right setting

I have even tried to adjust temperature

I am aiming for \~1:2 ratio (17-18g in - 36-40g out)

**In all cases the coffee starts nice and slow for about 2-4s (dark, thick) then its like the machine makes a sound, the flow goes instantly blonde and speeds up significantly (This happens when over extracted with clear channelling and when under extracted with low to no pressure)**

**I also cannot get extraction times above 18-20s (from pressing the button) without channelling, as soon as I try to go for higher extraction times I cannot manage without a bitter over extracted shot**

I would really appreciate some advice,

* Why is my coffee blonding so quickly?
* How can I up extraction times without getting an over extracted and bitter shot?

Hoping the coffee gods can help me :)",1610671192

Coffee,javajo91,kxfjo6,Ethiopian single origin clogging my Moccamaster - a cautionary tale,"Afternoon all!  

So I bought a really great Ethiopian light/medium roast from my local coffee shop here in New Jersey.  Been grinding it around 17-20 with my Baratza Encore.  

I'm also using the partial infusion method with my Moccamaster KB 741 where I'll close the filter off for the first 30 seconds of the brew while stirring the slurry.  

I've brewed this coffee about three times and all three times I've has close calls with the filter basket almost overfilling.

Today I made 1L with 57 grams of coffee ground at 18 on my Baratza.  I had a mess after my coffee stopped dripping.  Total clog...needed to stop the MM and transfer coffee in the filter basket to a pitcher and then transfer the wet grounds to a fresh filter basket where it eventually finished.

I've read on this forum that some origins/roasts produce more fines with Ethiopian being one of them - this makes sense for the clogging and slow drip time

I'm guessing that I need to either stop using the partial infusion method with my MM when brewing Ethiopian or grind much courser.

It was quite the site!  My MM is brand new so I baby it  - hated to see that happen to her.  :)",1610660646

Coffee,nbrs6121,kxa7k9,Help with Sour Drip Coffee,"I recently decided to get into a nicer coffee setup.  I grew up with a Bunn coffee maker and a can of Folgers.  I'd always enjoyed a good cup of coffee when I was out, but never really bothered to make it at home.  I decided to change that this year.

I purchased a Technivorm Moccamaster KBT-741 and a Baratza Encore, after doing a bit of research on the best gear in my price point.  I also went to a local roaster to pick up some of their beans.

I think I have made one good pot of coffee in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong with the others.  The problem I am having is that, no matter what I'm modifying, the water seems to just be pouring through too quickly.  I have tried grinding finer, but it's still dumping through in less than 4:30.

I am using the (essentially) 18:1 ratio recommended by Moccamaster, and am using a digital scale.  Notably, I am using 41.5 grams of beans to 750 ml of water.  I have tried grind settings from 22 to 18, all of which result in the exact same drip time.

The process I have been using is to close the drip for the first 30 seconds of the process.  At 15 seconds, I give the wet grind a little stir, and let the coffee bloom a little.  At 30 seconds, I open it to half (as recommended for 750 ml), and let it pour through.  I start the timer once the water first hits the grind and stop it once the water sinks through the top of the bed.

All of my batches are impossibly sour, like someone has poured lemon juice into my cup.  I know I need to get it to extract longer (5:30-6 minutes, I think) but grind size hasn't really made a difference.  I've even seen posts recommending grinds as coarse as 24 or 26 on the Encore for the Moccamaster.

Can someone help me with this?",1610645200

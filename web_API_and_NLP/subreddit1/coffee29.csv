I am in the market for a new grinder.  I have upgraded my home coffee bar to have almost all brew options, pour over, French press, drip, espresso machine, you name it.

Coffee,gregorie12,kveocj,"Popular V60 filters relative to each other? Cafec, Kono, Origami","Seems the Hario untabbed filters (40 ct) were popular, but have been seeing recommendations of Cafec filters performing even better (less clogging, reasonably faster drawdown time). That along with the fact that it is cheaper makes it seem like it's an obvious replacement for your go-to filters.

But Cafec has the traditional filters (which I assume most people are basing their comparisons with Hario on), Abaca version (which also seems as popular), and roast-specific (light, medium, and dark) filters. How do the Cafec offerings compare and in particular traditional vs. Abaca (which I assume are more for general-purpose before experimenting with their roast-specfic versions)?

And finally, there's Kono and Origami filters. I believe Origami might be the fastest of all the filters mentioned and Kono probably more similar to Cafec traditional and/or Abaca version.

Faster filters seem to be preferred in general because it lets you grind finer (for better extraction?), but I'm curious if there's a point where needing to grind too fine because the filter has too short of a drawdown is a detriment. I'm also interested to see if people who have tried the Cafec roast-specific versions actually found them to be worthwhile. I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIKSvEtBfyw) where the guy has tried the filters have preferred them over the traditional Cafec filters, but I feel his testing is flawed because he uses the same grind settings to compare between the traditional and roast-specific versions. That might be how Cafec intended or designed their filters around to using the same grind setting, but it would have been more interesting to give the traditional filter a better chance by dialing in a different grind setting.",1610406665

Coffee,Suluranit,kv5z4u,Absolute beginner; cheap or premium grinder?,"Hi everyone,

After spending most of my life wanting nothing to do with coffee (probably due to having bad experiences with probably bad coffee when I was younger), I finally decided that maybe I should give this thing a go afterall. I have done a bit of research and settled on getting an Aeropress for my first brewer, but I'm stuck on the grinder part...
  
I initially had my eyes set on a cheaper Hario, either the smaller one or the Skerton Pro, both often mentioned on the internet. Then a couple of days later I found out that one can and should spend much more on a grinder, so down the rabbit hole I went. In the end, I decided on an 1zpresso JX as it seemed to be a great grinder at a (barely) acceptable price range. Now then...
  
Given that I am pretty much all new to coffee, and with it the chance that I just don't like coffee regardless of how good or bad it is, should I try it out with a cheaper grinder first or bite the bullet and start the better one? Would the Hario be a hindrance to me getting into coffee? Though I have seen many here proclaim a substantial improvement in their drinks after upgrading their grinders, I am not sure that I have the palates necessary to detect the difference. Which one should I get? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1610382265

Coffee,botchspd13,kv3udy,Help! Trying everything to get a better cup and im stumped.,"I am perpetually stuck in coffee mediocrity limbo and im not sure where else to go at this point so if you could help that would be greatly appreciated.

First of all: I always use a 1:16 ratio for my V60, and im making enough coffee to serve two people. 35 g of ground coffee, yielding 544g. 
Ive played a lot with grind and generally find that the best i can do is at around the 14-16 setting on Encore, medium fine with a 4-4:30 draw down, following the Rao method. Sometimes ive tried much coarser and went for a 3:30 draw down only to find the coffee too weak and sour.

My setup uses the Plastic V60 (Size 02), i use the appropriate sized filters, and I have Baratza Encore (which im considering upgrading with the M2 Burrs very soon out of suspicion that this all may be a grind quality issue). I have a gooseneck kettle too, and an appropriate scale. The only thing im not doing is using specialty water because i am living somewhere with very high water quality, and frankly i really dont want have to spend more money up keeping mineral water, buying plastic water bottles when i have filtered brita water already.

Finally, the coffee im using rotates between mostly quality specialty roasters in Canada, mostly purchasing single origin coffee from Pilot, Quietly, Lüna, Phil &amp; Seb etc.

The problem is that no matter what i do, theres a kind of dry, astringent note that always accompanies my coffees. The notes on the bag barely come through no matter how i manipulate the grind, and though i can sometimes get a pleasant, sweet balanced cup, it is not happening consistently enough, even if i don’t change any of the variables.

I wonder if my palette is just not very good. I have trouble tasting bitterness, and “over extraction ends up just giving me a dry mouth sensation, as if i was having a dry cup of red wine as opposed to giving me a burnt toast kind of sensation. The worst of this problem is that all my coffee has this uniform kind of unpleasant acidic note in the background, no matter the origin or the supposed notes on the bag. Im driving myself nuts trying to figure out what the problem could be.

As a final note, its not like i dont like specialty coffee or even acidic coffees. Though im picky, i have enjoyed plenty of coffees from local cafes, many of which ive tried making using the same beans at home with less than stellar results.

Thank you for your time and reading this rant lol.",1610375830

I ofc tried to compensate this by making the grind coarser, but it made unsurprisingly low impact. (I usually grind 15-17 for 15/250, tried even going to 21 with no significant difference).

What I tried today was after pouring the initial 30g of water, I wouldn't stir but rather gently, but thoroughly mix everything up with a spoon.

Coffee,Mob_Nice,kuogcz,Anyone like Cafe Bustelo?,"I honestly don't mind it, especially for pre-ground grocery store coffee. If I feel like having cream or sugar in my coffee some days I will use bustelo instead of my good beans. 

It's too fine to use in my V60 so I usually just dump it in the old Mr. Coffee.

Also it will really wake you up, being Robusta beans and all.",1610316923
Coffee,dilwyn84,kun9gs,Can we better serve our coffee farmers?,"I often think about where my coffee comes from, and how well or poorly we are investing in the brazillian farmer, or the family in rwanda for example that we are getting our coffee from. With the influx of indie coffee brands have gaps between supplier and buyer started to close or is there much more work to be done? I've started several businesses and often considered if there's a way to better invest in these suppliers but come to the conclusion that I know barely anything about that side of things and that many people smarter than me must be working hard on it. Does anyone have any stories/knowledge regarding the sourcing of coffee and what steps are being taken to improve it and what is left to do? Thanks!",1610313545
Coffee,Snoo75302,kun7yu,got a moka pot,"1st brew was a disaster because i tamped the grounds and then wanted to watch it brew and had the lid open spraying coffee everywhere in one big burp.

i tried again without tamping the grounds down and its the best cup of coffee ive had in  a long time.

 stock standerd moka express and lavazza gran aroma. drank the whole pot in one cup and ... well im awake now. 

now i want to try lavazza and cuban coffee through it. i got single origin kilamanjaro, and crema gusta and my mom has coffee from cuba still. but i guess ill have to wait till tomorrow because the moka is really strong and i feel like sleeping tonight.

Coffee,funshitaccount,kuk9he,"Knockoff BWT Water Filter Cartridges, or changes in design?","I've ordered a few BWT replacement filter cartridges over the last 8 months or so, and each one has had a subtle difference in design. Given that they are not easily avaliable in the US, I have purchased from the UK mostly. Here are a few images of clearly different designs:

[From the current BWT website](https://www.bwt.com/de-ch/-/media/bwt/global-data/images/products/performancebundle_main2_1280x1280.png?rev=097fee019d7848abaa504ef1f23d1dd4&amp;h=640&amp;w=640&amp;hash=C3FA84F246FC0FC79C291B49E43266863E5C9CB7)

[From Google images](https://h2o.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BWT-Jug-Filter-Replacement-Cartridge-372x372.jpg), and also the design most similar to the 6 filter pack I bought 6 months ago

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know anything about these differences, or have you had the same experience with BWT filters? I have some basic test strips that come up good on each of the filters I have used, but the differences make me wonder if someone is out there making knockoffs.

I’m trying to find my perfect brew ratio for my drip coffee machine. What I have been noticing is that every time I take a sip of coffee when it is bitter/sour I instantly get a headache.

My husband thinks it’s because I drink too much coffee in which I get withdrawal and need more. But I went to Starbucks yesterday and got a blonde espresso shot in a latte. I never once got a headache and finally got coffee there that didn’t taste burnt/gross.

Coffee,aranhalaranja,kui6uw,Keurig?!?! (don’t murder me please),"Please don’t doxx me or murder my family for posting such a dirty word in such a classy sub. Just hear me out...

I have owned a Keurig machine for about a decade and before I became an aspiring coffee snob, I LOVED it! 

Now that I’m grinding my own coffee and using an Aeropress, I can’t tolerate it at all. It tastes like water mixed with used and molded coffee grinds! 

About once a week, however, I don’t have time to go through the ritual and I’m forced to fire up the Keurig. I am forced to add oat milk, which hides the awfulness, but it’s still extremely unenjoyable. 

But... 

Keurig cups are vacuum sealed. This, in theory, could keep them more fresh than a pre-ground bag that sits in the supply chain for weeks or months before arriving to your kitchen. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that checks water temp that could, in theory, heat the water to exactly 205 degrees Fahrenheit- or whatever the best heat is. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that pours out the water. This could, in theory, pour at some scientifically proven best rate. 

So... why is Keurig so goddamn awful? Is there a super fancy one out there that accounts for all these factors? Am I sitting on a million dollar idea that I just gave away to complete strangers? 

And, when all of you wake up late, need to get to the office quick, and have no time to grind, boil, individually pour, etc., what’s your go to? Is there a decent drip coffee maker or pre ground bag that you’d recommend? Or is there a k cup you’ve found that doesn’t completely suck?",1610298192

The grinder shows 0 on the dial, but if there's 40 grind settings, does it technically start at 1 and no such thing as a 0 grind size?

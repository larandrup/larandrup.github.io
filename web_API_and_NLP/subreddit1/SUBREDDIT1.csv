Coffee,AfternoonMoss,lfg46z,My coffee once grounded smells... really bad,"I've got some smaller bags of specialty coffee lately stepping beyond my previous cheaper market coffee and for the past 3 of 4 bags the coffee was an absolute treat to drink. Some more sweet/chocolate, some with a distinct fruity note. Now as I got to and opened the fourth bag of a different brand... I was rather surprised.

The roasted beans have a very intensive, bit oily smell of coffee. It has been dark roasted 3 months ago according to the label. It's a Ethiopia/Brasilia/Columbia blend of Arabica, naturally processed.  
Once grounded however a strong scent of excrement or urine is present, mixed with a very faint smell of coffee.

Have the beans gone bad? Is it safe to drink? What could have caused this?",1612803407

I have a sage barista express espresso machine and was have been having some issues with pressure. When I use the 1 cup single wall basket with the recommended grind size, grind amount and tamp pressure it works perfectly. 

When I try to use the 2 cup basket it doesn't work at all. I am using the recommended settings for the two cup basket. I have also tried using a finer grind size, higher grind amount and applying more pressure when tamping but it still doesn't work. It rarely creates even enough pressure to move the dial at all but when it does it never goes above the pre-infusion pressure.

I have tried using the 2 cup dual wall basket with the recommended settings and this too works perfectly. Can anybody help me figure out what the problem is?

I'm currently trying to cut down on my caffeine intake without going full decaf. I've found the most cost-effective way to do this is to buy a mix of normal coffee grinds and cheaper instant decaf. I alternate between the two every day: one day regular coffee, one day instead decaf. I don't particularly love the decaf, but I haven't really hated it in the few weeks I've been doing this either.

However, today's two cups were both disgusting. I took one sip of the instant decaf, and the only way I can describe it is that the taste was overly sweet and the consistency was slimy. I actually thought that I'd perhaps forgotten to rinse some soap out of my mug, so I put the kettle on again and made another cup. It was just as gross, and I tossed it.

This is instant decaf coffee with about a spoon-and-a-half of sugar and a splash of 2% milk. Has something like this happened to anyone before? I'm not sure if the problem is the coffee, the milk (smells meh, but not gross), the sugar, or even something like the water or the kettle.

Coffee,IntelligentAd8855,lcerze,How Do I Avoid Sour Oat Milk with Coffee? I need an Acidity Regulator ingredient.,"How Do I Avoid Sour Oat Milk With Coffee? I need an Acidity Regulator ingredient.

So.. I generally stick to 3 different Barista Oat Milk brands to have with my espresso coffees because I have found quite a lot of the Oat Milks (even if labelled as “Barista”) turn sour when added to an espresso coffee shot. 

My 3 safe Oat Milk brands for coffee:
- Oatly Barista Oat Milk
- Calfia Barista Oat Milk
- Alternative Barista Oat Milk

I compared the ingredients of Oatly Barista Milk and another ordinary oat milk, to find the difference was an “acidity regulator”! So I’m assuming it has something to do with the acidity level of the espresso shot and when the milk is added to that, then BAM! It goes sour. 

This is so painful because I really rather not spend $5 per Oat Milk carton.. plus Oat Milk is super easy to make, super cheap and tastes great, but when added to an espresso shot.... it’s absolutely disgusting. 

So.. does anyone have any recommendations of an “Acidity Regulator” ingredient I can put into my homemade Oat Milk to avoid the sour-tasting coffee?

P.S. I’ve already tried bi-carb/baking soda and I couldn’t have tasted anything worse..",1612442398

So today, I spent a good amount of time throwing together a document that will help me (and you) track all the different variables that change from one brew to the next. It’s a printable PDF and includes a lot of data points including, but not limited to, coffee dose, water, temperature, bloom time, time between pours, results, and much more. 

Here’s a link to the doc: [Coffee Brewing Test Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uly9oTnhMTbyJgQ5BxFdAho5XqnBvO6P/view)

I apologize in advance for the small text. In order to fit it all on one page, it had to be quite small. I wanted to be able to print out multiple double-sides sheets and collect them in a three-ring binder. 

Please note that when I starting building this form, it was to track my Chemex brew methods. This may or may not work for espresso, and may have to be tweaked a little to work for Aeropress. Maybe I’ll find the motivation to produce different forms for those.

Coffee,Worthasecondchance,lgu1ac,Long time barista looking to start making coffee at home,"Bit of context before I get into it - I've been a barista for about 7 or 8 years now, and in that time have mostly been working with commercial machines. Even though I have been *making* coffee for a long time (and certainly drinking a whole heap along the way), I don't think I've necessarily developed my knowledge on the depth of coffee as much as I should or could have. Even though I'm somewhat decent at my job, and am definitely an efficient and well experienced barista, I'd bet that 99% of the average home coffee enthusiast knows more about the different types of coffee preparation/flavours than I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My taste has evolved from drinking single shot 16oz caramel iced lattes when I first started working at Maccas, to drinking about 4 or 5 piccolos a day (or maybe a couple triple shot 8oz iced lattes on a hot day). I really want to get into the world of drinking black coffee (for both health and flavour appreciation reasons), but am struggling to find the best way to go about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst we do do cold drip and batch brew at the cafe I currently work at (and of course, long blacks), I usually don't have time to sit and sip a coffee while I'm on shift, so I'm looking for advice on how to start enjoying black coffee using home preparation methods rather than with a commercial machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question/s then becomes - What is the ""best"" way to start delving into the craft of preparing black coffee at home? I have dabbled in using a french press and moka pot as they seem to be the most commonly suggested, but am curious about V60s, aeropresses and chemex/pourover methods as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the second thing is, before going out and getting an espresso machine for the home (thinking of the Rancilio Silvia or La Marzocco Linea Mini down the line), would it be worth investing in a quality grinder first? My thinking is that I can use it to grind beans for preparing black coffee, and once I acquire an espresso machine, it can also be used for that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to know what you guys think, and open to any suggestions and guidance on what preparation would be best to start with, what beans to go for, or anything else!",1612965105

Coffee,hamzez,lgalne,1Zpresso JX-Pro Or Kinu M47 Phoenix?,"I’ve been recently dwelling into the coffee world and I’ve become more and more happy making a good cup of coffee. I mostly drink beans from a local shop in the morning and later switch to decaff. When I switched from instant coffee to an AeroPress my god the difference in taste was huge. I recently started grinding my own beans as well, but I’ve only been using an electric blade grinder since that was the cheapest option available. I didn’t realize how inconsistent my grind would be with a blade grinder, so my cup was different every time. While it was still a good cup (huge upgrade from instant coffee) I’ve been looking into investing into a good quality hand grinder that will last me for years. I’ve been looking around for a while and I just can’t seem to make up my mind on which one to get. Right now I’m torn between Kinu M47 Phoenix and the 1Zpresso JX-Pro. I was about to purchase a comandante c40 mk3 that got on sale for 221 euros but quickly got out of stock and now its back to 270 euro full price. I was also about to get an aergrind by knock but with the shipping costs the price bumps up to similar of the Kinu and the Jx-pro I then looked at the Timemore Slim but that quickly got out of stock as well so most of the good grinders at the 120euro price range aren’t going to be on stock anytime soon. Which is why I’ve been looking into the Kinum47 and the Jx-pro I’ve been hesitant to click on the order button because for me it is still A LOT of money to spend for a student but might have to be an investment, I’m going to make later on so why not make a good investment now with no regrets later?

Both the Kinu and the JX-pro seems to be well received in the community and both have great positives. I can get the kinum47 for 219euros and the Jx-pro for 199 right now that’s the lowest I can find them at a place that ships within eu (I live in DK so I can’t purchase anything overseas or it will get way too expensive) 

I’m planning to grind for AeroPress, French press and the V60 (which I ordered a few days ago I’m interested to see how that turns out) I don’t have the budget to make an espresso investment.

I like a grinder with decent capacity 25g+ and both of these seem very sturdy and durable which I quite like but I’d like to also have a grinder that is more on the simpler side one that doesn’t require too much maintenance and not finicky if that makes sense and one that doesn’t take ages to use since I mostly would be using it for my morning coffee. 

What do you guys think? Should I wait it out and just keep sticking to my blade grinder for the time being or should I make the investment and get either the Kinum47 or the JX-pro? Or would you think it’s not worth spending that amount of money and just wait until something like the Timemore Slim gets back into store?

Coffee,Acavia8,lg5gyg,Swiss-Water decaffeination process,"I am thinking about getting some decaf coffee, so I am reading about how it is made.  From what I read, the Swiss Water Process has two parts:  

1) it runs fresh, boiled runs water through some green coffee beans, and that water goes through some charcoal filters designed to only take the caffeine out of the water.   I assume those coffee beans are thrown away or used for something else.

2) That water, which has all coffee compounds, sans caffeine, is then run through the actual coffee beans that will be sold as decaffeinated.   Since the water has all  green coffee bean extractable compounds, except caffeine, in it, it will tend to only extract caffeine, from the targeted beans.

I printed out an excel sheet, with the following fields, that i filled up with each cup i made, including slight variations - bean, grind coarseness, amount of grind, water temp, amount of water, brew time, along with a few checkbox fields like preheat french press, stir before, stir after, beans to water / water to beans etc, and finally comments. All variables were tested, except for the beans, as i used different types each time, still on the hunt for the perfect bean, my all time fav was discontinued before i ever got a chance to grind my own. 

**After around a 100 cups, I found the following golden formula:** 

Grounds - 28g post grind, a tad bit finer than the regular french grind. 

Water - 350ml, 70 degrees C (158 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Method - beans ground, added to french press, water added to the grounds, as soon as all the water is in, its stirred, and then left for around 5-7 minutes. Pressed and poured. 

This temperature works especially for me because i cant stand having something so hot that i cant drink it immediately. and i love gulping the first sip ASAP once its in the cup. 

**Streamlining the process** \- Charting was cool and you feel like a scientist but im done, i got the formula for alchemy and now im just making gold. Grounds are done by a push of a button, found the exact time needed to get 28g of my grounds at the 24 setting on the baratza - 10.6 seconds. boiling water is added to about 50 ml of room temp water, which instantly creates a 70 degree mix, so no more thermometers. water levels are all marked on the press, so no more estimates either.",1612873417

Whilst the grinder was running I turned it clockwise, to make the ground coffee finer, so a little less water got through and I got a stronger espresso.

Are they all fairly barista friendly? Correct me if I’m wrong but I decided against machines like slayers/SR Opera as they are overly complex for some baristas. Would the following all be great options?

1 - Kees Van Der Westen Spirit

2 - Synesso MVP hydra

3 - San Remo Cafe Racer

4 - La Marzocco KB90

Coffee,cum_bandit,lfxg85,Why is the Lido 3 considered a good grinder?,"I got tricked into buying this piece of shit over two years ago and have begrudgingly used it that entire time since I don't feel like spending another $200 on one of OE's superior competitors. I genuinely do not understand how people can say that this is a good grinder and recommend it to others when alternatives exist. 

The construction is awful, with the folding handle constantly folding in on itself during grinding, and the threads in the ring stack getting filled with coffee particulates and being a pain to clean. 

Then the actual grind quality is about on par with a cheap $20 ceramic burr grinder. Mine came from the factory misaligned and I have never been able to successfully align it despite following OE's videos on realignment exactly. Just 10 minutes ago I inverted it, loosened the four screws attaching the burr ring to the hopper, removed the bottom shaft screw to allow the burr to rotate freely, exactly as shown by the designer, and turned the handle to ""align"" the burrs. Screwed everything back together, and I'm getting the burrs locked at -3 ticks and audible burr rub all the way to up 4 ticks. 

I wondered for a while whether I had received a fake or something, but I doubt that anyone would go to the trouble to fake a product this bad. People who actually shill this thing on here, what do you actually like about it?",1612856422

Having only a Hario Mini Mill grinder and having read that it can't grind for esspresso I thought it would work well with the ""not quite esspresso fine but finer than supermarket preground coffee"" recomandation. 

So I went with a 3 click setting and it actually looked finer than in the aforementioned video. I brewed anyway following instructions and tasted before mixing as advised. I was expecting something harsh and bitter but oddly enough my cup felt way underextracted.  
Now I'm pretty new to coffee brewing having spent only a few months with a V60 so maybe my tastebuds aren't familiar enought with the taste but the coffee was extremely sour and acidic (which if I undersand correcty means it is underextracted ?). I've tried again with an even longer steep time (from 90s to 180s) and it was somehow the same but worse.

Coffee,kindlyfellow,likmd8,Ratio question and thanks,"So this is my first post on reddit and this sub is the reason I joined so thank you all for all of the great content and advice on here. I came to this sub lamenting my Chemex which I had pretty consistently brewed what I thought was good coffee for about 5 years. Then everything changed after getting a better grinder ironically,  as I was then consistently making sour brews. The advice here helped me to keep grinding finer (despite manufacturer guidelines) until I found the sweet spot and to modify my process to avoid channelling which I didn't even know existed. So thanks folks. 

But as I was on a quest to solve my Chemex brew issue there was one thing I found that I just couldn't quite swallow, and that's the beans/water ratio factor. If one could get a great tasting brew in say a V60 or Kalita at 1:17, why would one want to waste more beans for another brew recipe/method that suggests 1:16 or less? Or am I missing something? Does it taste like an alltogether different animal? And yes I know taste is subjective, but any recipe I see that says to grind coarser and throw more beans at it I move on. I spend enough on the beans anyway LOL. Am I missing out though once in a while to give those recipes/methods a try?",1613163606

I've wondered for a while why there aren't more coffee mugs that have a bowl shape to focus the aromas of the brew the way a the shape of a wine glass does the same for the wine's aroma. Every time I nail a brew and the aromas are jumping out of the mug, it seems like a missed opportunity to not focus those aromas even more with the shape of the mug.

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here; maybe it's problematic to drink a hot beverage out of a bowl-shaped vessel?

I have made roughly 12 cups since I got the grinder with various grind sizes but I cant seem to get the draw down correct resulting in some over extracted coffee. It seems it is choking quite a bit more that I am used to seeing before when I was using the Encore. I typically use [James Hoffmann's 
 v60 recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) or modify it for a little more coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to determine if I am having issues with the 'fines' in the grind or if my issue is my paper filter. Through my own research I saw running a lot of old coffee through the Ode can help so I did that with about a 1000 grams worth of coffee. Looking for any help or recommended adjustments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Setup: 

* [Hario v60 (Decanter Version)](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Drip-Coffee-Decanter-700ml/dp/B00755F9Z4)
* [Hario Paper Filter with the Tab off to side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uggibTY0AE&amp;t=2s)

Recipe 1: 

* Brew ratio: 60 g/L 
   * Coffee: 30 g
   * Water: 500 mL
* Grind size: Medium
   * **Baratza Encore was set around 16 majority of the time**
   * **Fellow Ode was recommended 4 but I have made cups up to 8**
* Rinse paper filter 
* Add coffee grounds to V60 
* Start timer  at  0:00
* Add 2x coffee weight = 60 g of bloom water
* Bloom for up to 45 seconds  (0:45)
* Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight = 300 g in the next 30 seconds (1:15)
   * **This is where I start to see choke.** 
* Add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 seconds (1:45)
   * **I am unable to pour at this rate due to slow flow.**
* Stir 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon  This knocks off grounds from side wall  
* Allow V60 to drain a little 
* Give V60 a gentle swirl.
* Let brew drawdown. Aim to finish drawdawn by 3:30. 
   * **With the Encore I was seeing 3:15 to 3:30**
   * **With the Ode I am seeing 4:00 to 5:30.  Very over extracted**

&amp;#x200B;

Recipe 2: 

* Brew ratio: 60 g/L 
   * Coffee: 42 g
   * Water: 700 mL
* Grind size: Medium
   * **Baratza Encore was set around 18 majority of the time**
   * **Fellow Ode was recommended 6 but I have made cups up to 8**
* Rinse paper filter 
* Add coffee grounds to V60 
* Start timer  at  0:00
* Add 2x coffee weight = 84 g of bloom water
* Bloom for up to 45 seconds  (0:45)
* Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight = 420 g in the next 30 seconds (1:15)
   * **This is where I start to see choke.** 
* Add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 seconds (1:45)

so currently I'm using a pretty cheap coffee machine from philips. It was okay at the beginning but a few things are annoying. Its really really loud (especially if you do milk foam) and the coffee is mediocre at best.

My first plan was just to buy a newer/better coffee machine like the nivona 820 or something similar.  
But the more I look the more confused I get.  


Maybe first my drinking behavior:  
Most of the times I just drink one coffee (with milk) for breakfast (everyday). If I feel fancy I drink two or something with milk foam. But mostly just plain coffee with a shot milk.  


A few friends recommended me a espresso machines with a separate grinder. I kind of like the thought of that, but Im not sure if its useful if Im most of the time drink plain coffee.

So before I get too deep in the jungle of coffee machines I thought I seek help from you.

Coffee,hamzez,li9dc3,Caffeine!,"  

Im not sure if this should go as a post or if it fits into the question thread but:  
 

Caffeine!

I know calculating the caffeine content in different types of coffee is so variable because there is SO many factors to consider. I’ve been recently getting into coffee A LOT more and I tend to switch over to caffeine free after my first two cups of coffee. (I generally use the Aeropress for now) I’ve always counted for caffeine content in things just to make sure im not overdoing it or getting TOO addicted. Since I work out, I like to have a cup 30-60min before my workout but on somedays I don’t feel any different and somedays it hits like a rush. I generally use the same brew methods and grind size and beans with either just the original allan adler quick brew method(30-45s) or use an inverted method which makes the total brew time 1-2min.  
 

My question is which factors matter the most in terms of caffeine extraction? Obviously if you use more beans, you’ll have a higher caffeine content but would grinding finer or coarser have any effect? Would brewing for longer have a bigger effect, let’s say if you did a pour over on a v60 or a French press for example? What would be a top and low end of caffeine content in light roasted, medium roast, dark roast arabica beans just to have a general idea of a limit?

I realize answering question about caffeine in coffee is not that simple so my question is more leaning towards do any of you have any research or blogs, articles, informative reddit posts that has studied these things and have answers for some of them which gvies a bigger insight on caffeine content in different brewing method, grind size, time, heat ect ect..?

Do you have a general rule of thumb that you go by when it comes to counting your own daily caffeine consumption when drinking coffee and if so what did you base that metod on? 

I’d like to get more insight on this, so I’d appreciate your help :D",1613129942

I've been starting to get into the whole coffee-making thing in the last two weeks or so. At the moment I only own an electric blade grinder and a really old hand grinder that should probably belong in an antique store. I've been using the old one. It grinds quite unevenly so I thought one thing that I could improve in my set up, no matter how I brew the coffee, is the grinder. 
I know that there are very good hand grinders (like Comandante or so) that would probably satisfy all my needs but I don't know whether I'm entirely comfortable spending up to 300$ (including shipping and such) when just starting out. That's why I thought I'd get something like a Hario Slim, which seems to be a decent cheaper grinder, to start out with. Later, when I know what I need and what kind of brew I prefer and such, I could look at spending a bit more for a good hand grinder or and electric one (also: who knows? maybe in two months I'm like ""coffee brewing? no, thanks"" and then I'll have spent all that money for nothing).
From your experience, does make sense?

Coffee,_hanif,lhsynb,Exercise to Train Your Coffee Tasting (Without Drinking Coffee),"TL;DR (it's a looong one): Eat your fruits. 

I see a good number of people on this sub asking questions like, ""How do I learn to describe tasting notes?"" or even before that, ""How do I learn to taste tasting notes?""

I've seen lots of solid advice, like ""Do side-by-side comparisons,"" ""Try cupping,"" etc. Very good ideas and well worth your time, especially for the initial process of learning to distinguish one coffee from another. However, there came a time when I could easily tell two different coffees apart but still was no nearer to applying the type of exotic labels (pineapple! caramel!) that they throw on the side of bags. 

To develop this really niche and unnecessary (but cool) skill, I was led through a series of exercises designed to connect the physical sensation of a flavor to the mental response of a description; this type of exercise, done properly, ensures that you form the ""correct"" connections, ""correct"" meaning by the SCAA and CQI standards (not to deify ""the man"" like that, but it does help to have a standardized language so one person’s baking chocolate isn't another’s blood orange). 

In another age, you could go to SCAA Skills Building workshops and pay to get your hands dirty with the pros and their pro equipment like Le Nez du Café, a box of 36 bottled aromas that appear in coffee. Now you can’t, and you definitely don’t want to drop $300 on a box of liquid smells, but fortunately you can replicate the essence of the exercises at home. It can be tough without a teacher to pummel with questions, but here’s an exercise you can try that’s meant to open your understanding of the Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel, the magical hoop from which all the fun words are derived (see below). You don’t even need to buy any fancy coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

[Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel; or, The Magical Hoop, Root of All Pretension \(source: SCAA\)](https://preview.redd.it/4jotpoiahwg61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf2f2965e0527e75abccebe61d18aad0988d8c87)

1.  Go to the super market. Here’s your shopping list:

· 1 papaya (all these fruits can be whole or pre-cut. I recommend whole for maximum freshness and minimum salmonella)

· 1 mango

· 1 yellow banana

· 1 red banana

· 1 each of Red Delicious, Pink Lady, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, and Fuji apples (that’s 5 apples)

· 1 pink grapefruit

· 1 lime

· 1 normal orange (sweet or Valencia or navel, doesn’t really matter)

· 1 blood orange

· 1 lemon

· More than 1 blackberry

· Raspberries

· Strawberries

· Blueberries

· 1 or more dark chocolate bars (≥65% cacao)

· 1 small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips

· 1 Hershey’s milk chocolate bar

· A bag of mixed nuts with almonds, hazelnut, walnut, etc. (skip this if you’re allergic)

2.  Cut up the fruits and lay out all your foods in groups: the tropicals together, the apples together, the citrus, the berries, the chocolates, the nuts. You can set out toothpicks and cocktail napkins if you’re feeling dainty. Smell everything. Focus on the smells. This smorgasbord is your makeshift Le Nez du Café. 

3.  At this point I hope you’re not keto cause you’re about to house all this food. Each group will serve as an exercise for a different element of coffee tasting, and can be tackled in any order. Descriptions of each activity and my recommendation for order is as follows:

a.  **Malic Acidity with Apples**: Taste each variety of apple and **rank them from least to greatest in “intensity of acidity.”**Intensity of acidity is the strength or presence of both sweet and tart acids in a flavor. Though you are focusing on acidity, take note of the distinct flavor of each apple. Here I must emphasize the distinction between *eating* and *tasting*. Same physical actions, but in tasting you must be highly focused on the *sensation of flavor.* For you meditators, this is one of the finest real-world applications of meditative awareness. You must direct *all* your focus on the flavor you are tasting. Flavor is a fleeting thing, and early on, without full awareness, I found myself missing it entirely. Try, but if you miss it at first, try again. Train yourself to get “in the zone;” it becomes essential in cupping where things move fairly quickly.

b.  **Citric Acidity with Citrus Fruits**: **Rank the citrus fruits from least to greatest in intensity of acidity**. The difference between this type of acidity and the sweeter, malic acidity of apples is very apparent in the fruits themselves, but is tougher to distinguish in the context of coffee. Noting the unique flavors of each citrus fruit and comparing them with the flavors of the apples will help prepare you to detect, and more importantly distinguish, malic and citric acids in a cup of coffee. The citrus fruits are also helpful because they appear on the Flavor Wheel (tasting note words). I know you know what an orange tastes like. But you need to *really* know. This exercise combined with proper awareness trains your ability to mentally conjure the exact sensation of “tasting an orange,” which you can then detect in a cup of coffee.

c.  **Body with Tropical Fruits**: Taste each tropical fruit, **ranking them from least to greatest in “body.”** Body is the sensation of weight or thickness in the mouth, determined mostly by lipid (fat) content, and is a major factor in evaluating coffee. Compare each fruit to milk. Which has a thickness like skim milk, which like whole, and which like heavy cream? Again, while you’re focusing primarily on body, spend some time really tasting the flavor of these fruits; they show up on the Flavor Wheel and their sensations should be memorized. You can also focus on “mouthfeel,” the texture of the fruits. Are they creamy, chalky, silky? Something else?

d.  **Layered Flavor with Berries**: This one is challenging. Tasting each berry, focus as intensely as you can on its flavor and try to go beyond your pre-conceived “blackberry” or “raspberry” answer as your verbal response. What else is there in the flavor of a raspberry? Chocolate? Herbs? Flowers? Nuts? See what you can find when you really look. You may also choose to rank the berries by intensity of acidity, body, or even how complex you find their flavors (by how complex, I mean how many other flavors you can detect that constitute the entire flavor). Berry flavors are an essential part of the Flavor Wheel. Become extremely familiar with the sensation of tasting each berry.

e.  **Bitterness with Chocolate**: Melt a piece of each chocolate on your tongue. Focus on everything discussed above (flavor, body, acidity) as well as bitterness, and notice how the level bitterness changes with the type of chocolate. Decide which levels of bitterness are most pleasant to you. Also focus on the lingering sensation in the mouth after eating chocolate. This sensation becomes important when trying to identify chocolate notes in a coffee.

f.  **Flavor with Nuts**: With the nuts, mostly the same deal. Focus on their flavor. Know an almond from a peanut from a hazelnut on a deep level. They all appear on the Flavor Wheel.

Thus concludes the exercise. Write your rankings and thoughts down as you go. Be confident in them but do not be afraid to be wrong; the ability to rank fruits based on certain qualities is not natural or instinctual in the human. You’re not made to be good at it. It must be trained.

Now you may ask: how do I effectively apply this to coffee tasting? Coffee is evaluated on its aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, and body, all very jargonized ideas to which your brain can only prescribe “sensational” definitions to through experience. Now that you have experience 

Remember the berries, and how you focused on moving beyond the pre-conceived notion of “xberry.” This is what a roaster or cupper is doing when they ascribe tasting notes to a coffee. Coffee with blueberry notes isn’t going to taste like a blueberry smoothie; coffee is always gonna taste like coffee. They get “blueberry” because they have trained their brain to be so familiar with the sensation of tasting blueberry that they can also get that sensation from things that are not blueberries but carry some similarities. Finding tasting notes in coffee is much like the instinctual phenomenon of finding “faces” in things that don’t really have faces, like a wall outlet. Our brain *knows* faces, and a cupper’s brain *knows* flavors in the same way. 

A good way to practice with coffee is to look at the Flavor Wheel while tasting. Start general, like in a game of 20 Questions. Are you sensing Chocolates, Fruits, Spices, or Something Bad? Ok, fruit. Is it tropical, citrus, berry? And so on. You don’t need to land on a specific food in the beginning. “This coffee is chocolatey and fruity” is a fine step from, “This is coffee.” Let, ""This coffee has the aroma of brown sugar and strong notes of almond and vanilla,"" come later.

[Here is an ""answer key"" to the rankings of the fruits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaMnA0OAc1qdMyUuvJHr_WMjhkxu_xOq/view?usp=sharing). Don’t look at it until you’ve done the exercise, please. When training the senses, it’s so important to rely on the senses alone. It is very easy for suggestion and bias to get in the way and limit your learning. 

Hope you enjoy, and let me know if you tried it. Keep learning and keep drinking coffee.",1613072987

Setup specs:
Gaggia Classic Pro
 - 9 bar pressure spring 
 - Brass shower holder
 - IMS Shower head 
 - IMS Portafilter Basket 
58.4mm Tamper 
Compak E5 Grinder 

I’ve watched many videos to make sure my tamp is even and consistent and the grounds are evenly distributed. 

I can make perfect espresso’s all day long at my parents house with a different setup (given it is way nicer than mine and probably more forgiving). I’m trying to figure out how to get a well extracted pull without dropping $1k-4k on a nicer machine. 

I get coffee from a local 3rd wave roaster and usually finish the bag within 3-4 weeks of roast date. 

Things I’ve noticed:
- If I grind coarser then it doesn’t channel but predictably it brews too quickly. The espresso is thin with little to no crema. Tastes under-extracted and bitter. 

- If I grind finer then it brews longer but always channels. Looking at the puck there are always 1-3 pinhole channels. With the finer grind then the grounds look almost ‘mushy’ on the top which I have only ever encountered on this machine.  It tastes alright but I know that there is more potential there. 

In my experiences with my parents machine if the grind is too fine then it comes out way too slow and tastes sour. I’ve never managed that with my home setup. Even with the grinder on its finest setting. It’ll just channel and pull 2oz in 15 seconds. 

- I’ve tried adjusting the firmness of tamp which doesn’t seem to make too much difference. 

-I started using the steamer knob to lower the pressure to mock ‘pre-infusion’ which helped quite a lot but hasn’t solved the problem. 

I find it strange that I have never had channeling issues with the other machines I’ve used but with my home setup I have I can’t seem to avoid it. The only mod for the Gaggia I haven’t gotten is the PID kit but I’m not sure that’ll fix the situation.

I thank anyone who has made it this far in my narrative! The question I’m asking is: Am I missing something or doing something wrong? Are my expectations just too high for the equipment I have?",1613065113

Coffee,CoffeeAll01,lhl8r4,How to make smooth and rich Arabic or Turkish coffee,"We’re going to to learn how to make Arabic or Turkish coffee with a couple of helpful tips on how to get it smooth and rich.

We’re going to need a coffee pot or an ibrik. We’re also going to need fresh cold water and Arabic coffee grounds. 

First, we’re going to fill the ibrik with the fresh cold water about half way and then we’re going to bring the water to a boil on our stovetop. Once the water starts boiling we’re going to turn off the heat and go and grab our Arabic coffee grounds from the fridge. It’s important once we open the package of pre-ground Arabic coffee we place them in a jar in the fridge to maintain its freshness. Now we’re going to put the right amount of coffee grounds in the ibrik. Here we’re going to put one heaping table spoon for about one cup and a half of water. Tip 1: For this we’re going to tap the coffee grounds in the water, not stir, to macerate them in the water. It should take about four taps, don’t over do it. The reason for this is to lightly macerate the coffee grounds with the hot water so they can later foam up for the next step. Tip 2: Once we’ve done that then we’re going to reheat the water with a medium low to medium heat. For this step it’s counter intuitive, you might think in order to get the coffee to taste smooth we should put it on low heat to prevent the coffee from over cooking and tasting bitter but in actuality it cooks the coffee for a longer period of time therefore, coming out bitter. Putting the fire on medium low to medium is going to speed up the brewing process plus it’s going to make the coffee come out smooth tasting. Now when the coffee starts to rise, lower down the heat to low to prevent the coffee from overflowing and let it gently rise regulating the heat according to the rising of the coffee. Then we’re going to keep the fire under the coffee until it settles and after settling keep the fire on low for about five seconds before turning off the heat.

Serve using a Demitasse. And there we have it smooth and rich Arabic or Turkish coffee ready to drink. Enjoy.",1613052090
Coffee,gonenow94,lhl2in,Why might coffee suddenly start turning out watery and weak?,"I got a Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker about a week ago. I love it and it’s been great, up until yesterday. Now I can’t get a decent cup of coffee from it.

Coffee,fichoman,lhkwz3,"Well, it's gone boys, it's gone and I don't think I can bring it back","Tl,dr: Accidentally had the perfect grind size, after messing with my grinder I can't get any fruitiness from my Ethiopia natural, I've been trying for days now and I'm lost 


Always loved the taste of coffee, pure, unadulterated coffee, but for many reasons I couldn't drink it for a couple of years so I switched to tea, and let me tell you I love tea, but it's not coffee, and you can't really drink that much per day without geting weirdly but intensely and uncomfortably high on caffeine+L-theanine,  
anyway,  
Recently got into specialty coffee, I was really excited, got myself a grinder (it's an old handmade turkish metal burr grinder, it's hard to disassemble, it's so heavy you can kill a fully grown horse with it and even one cup of coffee is a workout, but it grinds so uniform it's ridicolous)  
So at first i thought you can't modulate grind size, so i just put some Ethiopia natural coffee beans inside and ground it to basically a turkish grind, but you could still feel the grinds between your fingers, it wasnt dusty,  
I made a pour over with it, it worked,  
It was so good, it tasted like white chocolate, strawberries and everything that coffee can be,  
I was ecstatic,  
It reminded me of the first time i tried an IPA, that mixture of pleasant bitterness and unbelievable fruitiness, it really was that intense,  
I made another cup, immersion this time, got the same result, 
    
.  
But than i got to dismantling the grinder and cleaning it, in the process I noticed there is a screw for modulating grind size, i released it to clean it better and, after putting it all back together, tried experimenting with coarser grinds,  
Didn't really work...  
So I tightened it back and tried again,  
Nothing,  
No bitterness, no sourness, amazing coffee, just absolutely fruitless,  
  
It's been three days now, I have consumed, and spilled, God knows how much coffee and not once got anything other than ""mildly fruity but only if you really focus""  
  
I'm at a loss, i wake up every day hoping this will be the day, but i just can't get it to work,  
I just want to try so many coffees, i got a half kilo of unroasted Sumatra gayo and I'm even eyeing a bag of Columbian experimental lacto-fermented natural/honey process heat shock beans whith a taste profile worthy of the gods,  
  
But what's the point if I can't figure out why my cups are so uninteresting,

Coffee,siderealseraph,lhce56,[question] what are my upgrade options from a cheap drip pot of Bustello?,"disclaimer: I know very little about coffee

what are good options to consider upgrading from here? I can only assume this is the starting point in the world of coffee making.

Coffee,rabidsoggymoose,lhc0lf,Cafflano Kompresso has some serious design problems?,"I've been experimenting with the Kompresso and there are a couple of things that concern me. I'm not sure how much these things will affect extraction, but the possibility is maybe theoretically there? I'd like some input from Kompresso users.

1. The tamper is trash. The tamper is the bottom of the scoop and the diameter isn't even flush with the portafilter basket, so when you tamp down there are still grinds all up along the walls of the portafilter. Plus the Cafflano logo is printed on the bottom and leaves an imprint in the coffee, which means the tamp can never be completely even, by design.

2. The portafilter's bottom screen is a thin piece of pressed steel. The middle of it bows outwards with pressure and now it stays a bit bowed out in the middle. You can press on it and it will flex back and forth. 

This means the center column of coffee is always going to be a bit thicker than at the edges due to the concave bowed shape, and when I press down the first bits of extraction *always* start coming out from the outside edge of the screen and dripping from the middle of the screen only arrives some time later. So the flimsiness of the portafilter screen seems to guarantee more extraction of the grinds at the outside perimeter than the middle. 

Why they chose to use a flimsy flexible screen rather than a plate or thicker material is beyond me. None of the portable hand-pumped machines have this property. It would not add much more weight.

Coffee,Semper_0FP,lh27jj,What I learned today: You do not need to use 30g of coarsely ground coffee to obtain a good cup from an Aeropress.,"I've had my fair share of frustrations trying to get a good cup out of my Aeropress using medium roasts. Some advice I saw was to use the Aeropress competition winner recipes, but halve the dose from 30g to 15g and grind slightly finer.

For the competition brew I used a setting of 26 on my Baratza Encore grinder. It's just a tad shy of french press coarseness. For the halved dose, I tried 20-22 and got horrid results.

The past two days I've done the following as I've noticed a coarse grind really helps in the Aeropress. The result is a nicely balanced cup on the chocolatey side. It could use a tad more flavor strength but I am still playing around with that. Not sure if that's from diluting at the end or if it needs a few more seconds brewing.

Brewer: Aeropress with Fellow Prismo Attachment. I do not invert.

Filter: Fellow Prismo metal filter and a washed Aeropress filter

Grinder: Baratza Encore on setting 26. This is maybe 3-4 clicks shy of french press coarseness.

Beans: Something medium, 18g

Pro-tip here: I bought a flour strainer on Amazon to strain my grind. I find my Encore leaves some fine dust even in a coarse grind. I dump my grind onto the flour strainer over the sink and sift for about 20-30 seconds. I found this removed an entire gram of weight today. What's left is a fairly consistent grind with a small percentage being a bit smaller than the rest.

Water: Boiled from the tap. I live in Seattle and have soft water. I let the temp drop down to ~200F. Yesterday I got a stronger cup when I poured it in at 202F, today I went in at 198F and got a slightly less tasty cup.

I bloom for about 15-30 seconds with 40-50ml of water I don't really know if this is necessary. I also stir it a tad to make sure everything is wet. By 30 seconds, I pour up until 150ml of water making sure to get everything saturated with water. I stir up until the point where the beans aren't clumped together anymore and are suspended in the water. At 1:20 to 1:30, I plunge for 40-60 seconds. I've been plunging at the 1:20 mark normally but perhaps another 10 seconds might be better. 

Then dilute with 50-100ml of water, your preference here. I did 80ml and found it mild but still tasty. 60 or 70ml might be more bold.

The cup I'm getting has zero bitterness or sourness. It's a flavorful, sweet cup. Almost like a slightly weaker french press without it seeming too watery.",1612986949

Now I know this is just my opinion and is different for everyone.

Coffee,johnAckerman777,laov4o,I am new to making coffee at home.,"Hello everyone, as the headline said I am new to making coffee at home and i have some General questions and I would love some feed back :) 

I Recently started making coffee at home because I realized I was spending so much a month on coffee and espresso to the tune of 100-150 a month, so I decided to buy a French press and whole bean coffee. I enjoy the more hands on approach and didn't want to bother with Instant coffee hoping I could get a better brew. 

So a few of my questions are sense I am using a french press I am grinding my Coffee beans fairly course and would it be safe to flush them down the sink or would It clog my sink pipes? I am a little concerned that it might and I can't seem to find a straight forward answer when looking on google. 

My second question, the beans I bought are from jumping bean, specifically there french Colombian dark roast, I enjoy the flavors of dark roasted coffee however I do like the lighter roasted coffee aswell. 
I would love to have some recommendations and maybe links to websites where I can find the perfect type for me if that is possible for you guys to help me with :) 

My third and final question revolves around the French press I am using, how would I go about making the coffee more consistent, steeping times, Amount Of ground coffee per litre of Water any and all help and foresight would be very appreciated. 

Much thanks from a very big coffee loving Canadian.",1612245321

As a coffee noob, I made the mistake of throwing some money at Starbucks' ""medium roast"" Ethiopian beans. Some people would probably like it but both me and my brother hate it because they always come out very bitter. I've read over the internet that most Starbucks beans are okay  with milk to hide the bitterness, but I don't really prefer milk in my coffee.

Coffee,jessi-poo,lakgoy,Breville Dual Boiler - how to open up??,"I need to get to the OPV and pop the top open to do so. (for reference, with a blank disc it's only getting up to 9-9.5 so my shots, it never has, my machine is 2 months old, won't go higher than 8.5 on a good day for my espresso, my shots taste weak).

So I found some tutorials that explained there are 4 screws:

* 2 on the back you need torque heads, I got those out since I have the bit, no issues
* 2 next to the group head

I can't for the life of me get the 2 next to the group head to budge.

* I tried my little dremel drill on a weak setting with the extension, doesn't work so I figured maybe the thickness of the extension was blocking at some point and it wasn't reaching the screw head
* I got a 0x3 and a 1x4 Philips screwdriver from a neighbor, still not working! I can't get either of those 2 screws to budge at all. They will not move. Screwdrivers are on the pointier side and maybe it doesn't have that great of a grip but for it to not move at all
* I tried another one of my skinny weak screwdrivers this time with a flat head just to try to latch onto something, couldn't turn it at all, I was turning red from exhaustion

I'm stumped, nobody else has had this issue. I just see posts with the thing open and to remove the screws but not 1 comment about the difficulty top open this thing up. Is there a trick to this? I even tried putting it down so it's lying down, having my opposite hand push back on the top while I try to jam the screwdriver to really get a good grip - still no. I'm not sure what they did in the Breville factory for it to be stuck in there so good!

EDIT: After scouring the internet for 2 hours, I found 1 single post that mentions this [https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/breville-dual-boiler-mods-and-maintenance-t61421-140.html](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/breville-dual-boiler-mods-and-maintenance-t61421-140.html) A helpful user mentions: JIS #2 screwdriver or bits

Coffee,Waryur,lajquq,At a local 3rd wave café the espresso tastes... kind of gross?,"I like espresso. At least I thought I like espresso. I would always be sure to get a ""free sample"" from the Nespresso machine that they had at Crate and Barrel before the pandemic. When at an Italian restaurant I like to get one after the meal, as they do in Italy. But I just can't stand the espresso at this café I like. Their regular coffee pot coffee and pourovers are excellent, and they have good pastries and sandwiches. But every time I've gotten an espresso from there it's just Battery Acid. I recently got a cappucino and it had an odd sourness—I can't tell if the milk had gone or if that was just their espresso. I know that this place, like most ""nice"" cafés nowadays, really push the fruity light roasts, and that Italians tend to like a darker roast. But I can't even imagine this stuff being drinkable?? I have a Breville Bambino and Trader Joe's ""Espresso Blend"" (blend of arabica and robusta, allegedly ""light-medium"" roast but the beans are rather oily!) and while it's not the super authentic beautiful espresso because it uses one of those ""cheaty"" double-wall baskets, I enjoy the taste of that stuff infinitely more than the café's espresso. Is this just me not being used to light-roast espresso or are they doing it wrong... and if it's their fault how can I politely tell them I'm not impressed?",1612228490

Coffee,CoffeeandTech72,lad5gm,Coffee journey - Share yours or just come and chat!,"Going years back I never enjoyed coffee. I became used to the thought that strong coffee meant it almost had a burnt taste in an Americano. I drank it for the caffeine but never looked forward to having it, in fact, I prefered energy drinks. However, when I discovered there was more to coffee than Starbucks, that changed quickly. 

I chose to study abroad in Melbourne, Australia. For those of you who aren't familiar, I was in for a treat because Melbourne is considered the coffee capital of Australia. I began checking different cafes out still getting my usual Americano but I started to discover different tastes each time. I couldn't spot the difference but I knew it was there. I fell in love with coffee the taste of coffee while I was there!

When I returned I eventually ended up working for Starbucks (not for the coffee but more for their scholarship for college). However, this choice changed my life. I realized how much goes into the craft of coffee. I participated in coffee tastings, experimented with espresso, paired coffee with a pastry to bring out the notes mores, etc. Now, Starbucks gets a bad rep for some of their coffee but they did have a few that were surprisingly good. This opened my eyes to specialty coffee and specialty coffee shops. I am addicted to the TASTE of coffee rather than the caffeine it contains. I've had coffee where it tastes surprisingly fruity, flowery, and some with nice sweet acidity. I love the massive variety and potential that lies within each cup! This is what I wake up for every day!!

Now, I just want to learn more about coffee and continue to expand my knowledgebase and hopefully open a cafe one day!

Going to Melbourne, Australia and working for Starbucks changed my life in a way I would never have guessed. When did you all find your passion for coffee? What are you doing now to continue expanding your skills/knowledge of coffee?",1612211218

Coffee,EddyIsReady,laa8kn,Constant Flat tasting Pour Over - Need Help,"I really hate the fact that I'm making this post. I'm a self-proclaimed coffee nerd and long time enthusiast. I've been seriously brewing pour over coffee for three years with great mid-range gear and fresh specialty coffee. I've come to this problem where I can't seem to get flavors out of my coffee, and each cup tastes flat and lacks depth. I think my main culprit here is channeling, but I'm not sure what to do or how to diagnose.

&amp;#x200B;

I grind with the Lido 3 at a similar grind size to Square Mile's sample grinds. I bought a new Lido 3 a couple months ago, upgrading from my Baratza Encore. This past year I've been brewing mostly with a v60 (Jame's Hoffman's recipe), but also own a Kalita Wave and Clever Dripper. Being in Seattle, I have great access to high quality freshly roasted specialty beans. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days ago I went to my favorite cafe and had some Panama beans on pour over. The coffee distinctly tasted like chocolate and strawberries. It was a vibrant cup and I had no issue picking out those tasting notes. Delicious cup. I decided to buy the beans with a roast date of 1/26 and wanted to replicate these flavors at home. The shop I went to used a Kalita Wave, but I've brewed three cups so far on a V60 and none of them have been close to what I tasted at the cafe. As my coffee cools the strawberry and chocolate come out, but it's maybe 50% of what I was tasting from the cafe.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good, clean grinder. I use filtered water, I have around 3 minute brew times and have a flat clean bed every time. What can I possibly do to diagnose what's going on? Should I switch to french press for a bit? Go back to my Kalita Wave? Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

And a long shot here, but would anyone be interested in a coffee related discord or similar community? I really think I've gotten to the point I need someone to watch me make pour over and critique me. I'm really getting disappointed with these consistently flat and boring cups.

Edit: thanks for everyone's help so far. I brewed a French press and it had the same boring flavor. I'm going to continue experimenting with water until I get my French press to taste good, then move on to the kalita.",1612204192

I use some random Starbucks light roast beans, a blade grinder and a drip coffee machine. I know that to you, that probably doesn't sound too great haha 

But with whole milk, it smells like raspberries and tastes really sweet. But because you guys told me how milk covers up many aspects of coffee, I intentionally drank a cup or two of coffee with milk, and a small coffee cup with black coffee every morning for a week. 

And now, I decided that I might as well not use milk at all this time because it's actually pretty good. It's a lot stronger and kinda fruity. The raspberry taste is totally gone when drinking it black (you did also say that milk can also bring out new flavors, which it does for this coffee), but drinking this black reminds me of drinking tea. 

Thank you for pushing me, I feel like my eyes have opened lmao I feel like I got a better idea of how coffee is supposed to be drunk (just being mindful of what different additives do to coffee. So if I want this tea-like coffee, I'll drink it black. And if I want that Starbucks taste, I'll use milk) and I'm so excited about getting into pour-over coffee and stuff like that. Maybe I'll even get a burr grinder one day or something (for now, that's kinda expensive since I'm just a 19yo student).

It sounded like everything was normal, but only a small amount dripped and was very bitter. Ended up with ~ 1tsp of drip.

Last night I cleaned the entire machine. This morning I did the usual 20 minute wait then made my first double shot - perfect. The second shot had the same issue as yesterday!

Coffee,burned_pixel,la3tuv,Nespresso as an americano is not horrible,"So, hey y'all. I hope everyone's doing great.

At home, I am the coffee loving person. My father comes in as a close second, but he always puts simplicity before flavor, so ""good"" instant coffee and nespresso are his go to. I grind my own beans and brew my Java in ways he considers exaggerated, though for the average r/coffee User they would be pretty average. So, we keep two nespresso machines in the house.

Recently my kitchen has had some work being done to it, so my usual coffee heaven is out of service for a little while. Personally I can't stand instant coffee since I started brewing my own, there's just a metallic taste to it, so I turned to the second worst option, nespresso. I know what everyone here about their coffee, but imo it's not nearly as bad as people here make it to be, though there is room for improvement. 

What solution did I find? An Americano. I pull an espresso sized shot out of the machine, let the capsule fall through, and press the button once again to let some hot water flow into my coffee, essentially doubling its size. It really helps masks those weird flavours associated with nespresso coffee, but still giving a somewhat strong coffee. I hope this helps anyone.

Cheers everybody!

EDIT: First of all, a silver for this simple thread? Thank you stranger!! Secondly, I think the conversation got really interesting. I agree with most of you, nespresso is not terrible, specially when there are extra steps taken (adding water for an americano, milk, condensed milk, etc.).

Coffee,redditinface,l9vhvd,"What's the least amount of coffee I can make? (Or rather, make well)","This subreddit has made me obsessed in the last couple of months. Now all I want to do is read about coffee making methods, try new techniques, and continually tweak my recipe. Bought an Encore, a Wave, a Clever dripper and a scale, and haven't looked back. (Not true. Yesterday I looked back long enough to order a JX Pro.)

Here's my problem: I'm incredibly sensitive to caffeine, so I've been using 9g coffee and 150g water in my Clever dripper. But I haven't seen anyone use less than 15/250, so I'm wondering if I'm limiting my coffee quality by trying to make such a small amount. (Because of poor heat retention? Some other mechanism I'm not thinking of?) I could of course just make 15/250, but that will tempt me to overcaffeinate and be up half the night. But if I must to pursue perfection, so be it.

Coffee,201power,l9u6r9,V60 pour over: which stage contribute most to after odor / taste?,"One thing I enjoyed a lot from pour over is the long lingering after odor /  taste.

Which stage of pour over contribute most to the after odor / taste?

I did a quick experiment today, use April's V60 recipe, with Lily dripper. Total 4 pours  and for each pour use different cup.

Recipe: 13g coffee, 200g 195F water, C40 30 click grind size

4 x 50g pour every 30 seconds. between each pour water drained completed. total time 2:00

Result

* 1st 50g: sharp acidity
* 2nd 50g: sweet aroma, less acidity than 1st 50g, some after ordor
* 3rd 50g: very sweet, some after ordor
* 4th 50g: a little sweet, tea like taste

Then I combine:

* 1st + 2nd: very bright and acidic
* 1st + 2nd + 3rd: acidity become more acceptable 
* 1st + 2nd + 3rd + 4th: balance of acidity and sweetness. much more after ordor / taste

It seems the 4th pour contribute most to the after taste. Any people have similar finding?

According to BH, largest molecular contribute most to  Retronasal olfactional. **does this mean later stage of pour extract more large molecular**? If increase water ratio more, will I get even stronger after taste?

We put that and a pinch of salt into [this cheap Bayka french press](https://www.amazon.com/BAYKA-French-Double-Wall-Filtration-Dishwasher/dp/B07VFFZF7H/ref=sr_1_13_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=french+press&amp;qid=1612136584&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sr=1-13-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMTlVT0FLTVBVWDUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1NDc2MDAxUzdERlZIN01CTVhHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwNDIxODEyQkVPQ0U4OUpHUTJVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and fill it up with 200F water, steep for 4 minutes, then plunge and drink.

Those doesn't even have a ""seam"", just a sharp metal edge lightly folded over that's also already frayed.

At this point we're wondering:

* Can we get decent metal mesh filters anywhere?
* Is it worth switching to a cloth filter like [these polyester ones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JU89OGE/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) instead?

I was feeling pretty close to pulling the trigger on a $150 machine when I happen to be wandering through a Habitat Restore and saw a used Behmor Brazen Plus 3.0 on the shelf for $15!  I hear stories of people finding cool coffee gear for cheap at thrift shops, but never figured I’d be so lucky. Well maybe I was lucky and maybe I wasn’t because I pulled open the basket and it had been left with the grounds for who knows how long and was FULL of mold. Could I get it clean? For $15 I had to give it a try. I spent the better part of the day today disassembling it to clean it out all the way. Let me tell you what, taking apart at Brazen is not for the faint of heart. I wrecked some of the exterior plastic casing trying to pry here and there and was sure I wouldn’t turn on by the time I got it back together. But I got into the shower head and the channel between the reservoir and got all the mold clear (yes it had grow almost all the way up through to the reservoir). Got it all back together and it seems to function 100%!

Coffee,nosrac6221,l9n49d,Resting period horror story!,"About 3 weeks ago I ordered coffee from the renowned roaster La Cabra in Denmark, it was a pack with 3x250g of their standard coffees and 1x100 of a special semi-carbonic maceration process Gesha from Gesha Village in Ethiopia. Needless to say I was so excited to try the Gesha. When it finally arrived to the USA, the 3 standard coffees were 2 weeks off roast and I was confused that the Gesha had been roasted 8 days prior to the other 3 coffees (even before I placed the order)! I was so scared that it would be past its prime, so I immediately set to work trying to dial in this coffee - but every cup came out tasting very flat, whether extracted for 2:45 or 4:00 or in between. I felt as though they had sent me stale coffee and was quite upset. But in the back of my mind I had the idea that perhaps they intentionally sent me coffee that had rested longer. Maybe this coffee needed a particularly long resting period. So with only less than half of the beans left I decided to wait another week before brewing this Gesha again. Lo and behold, the coffee has developed substantially and is now quite delicious (1 month off roast). I will be waiting a few more days even to brew the last 2 cups.

I should have figured that real professionals like La Cabra knew what they were doing sending me older coffee. And it is quite remarkable that the other coffees I ordered were ready to drink straight away (2 weeks off roast)! Some coffees really do take different times to develop after roasting, hopefully this can help you all avoid running through a lot of beans trying to make an elusive cup that will not taste good no matter what recipe.",1612130244

Coffee,gregorie12,kveocj,"Popular V60 filters relative to each other? Cafec, Kono, Origami","Seems the Hario untabbed filters (40 ct) were popular, but have been seeing recommendations of Cafec filters performing even better (less clogging, reasonably faster drawdown time). That along with the fact that it is cheaper makes it seem like it's an obvious replacement for your go-to filters.

But Cafec has the traditional filters (which I assume most people are basing their comparisons with Hario on), Abaca version (which also seems as popular), and roast-specific (light, medium, and dark) filters. How do the Cafec offerings compare and in particular traditional vs. Abaca (which I assume are more for general-purpose before experimenting with their roast-specfic versions)?

And finally, there's Kono and Origami filters. I believe Origami might be the fastest of all the filters mentioned and Kono probably more similar to Cafec traditional and/or Abaca version.

Faster filters seem to be preferred in general because it lets you grind finer (for better extraction?), but I'm curious if there's a point where needing to grind too fine because the filter has too short of a drawdown is a detriment. I'm also interested to see if people who have tried the Cafec roast-specific versions actually found them to be worthwhile. I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIKSvEtBfyw) where the guy has tried the filters have preferred them over the traditional Cafec filters, but I feel his testing is flawed because he uses the same grind settings to compare between the traditional and roast-specific versions. That might be how Cafec intended or designed their filters around to using the same grind setting, but it would have been more interesting to give the traditional filter a better chance by dialing in a different grind setting.",1610406665

After spending most of my life wanting nothing to do with coffee (probably due to having bad experiences with probably bad coffee when I was younger), I finally decided that maybe I should give this thing a go afterall. I have done a bit of research and settled on getting an Aeropress for my first brewer, but I'm stuck on the grinder part...
  
I initially had my eyes set on a cheaper Hario, either the smaller one or the Skerton Pro, both often mentioned on the internet. Then a couple of days later I found out that one can and should spend much more on a grinder, so down the rabbit hole I went. In the end, I decided on an 1zpresso JX as it seemed to be a great grinder at a (barely) acceptable price range. Now then...
  
Given that I am pretty much all new to coffee, and with it the chance that I just don't like coffee regardless of how good or bad it is, should I try it out with a cheaper grinder first or bite the bullet and start the better one? Would the Hario be a hindrance to me getting into coffee?

Coffee,botchspd13,kv3udy,Help! Trying everything to get a better cup and im stumped.,"I am perpetually stuck in coffee mediocrity limbo and im not sure where else to go at this point so if you could help that would be greatly appreciated.

First of all: I always use a 1:16 ratio for my V60, and im making enough coffee to serve two people. 35 g of ground coffee, yielding 544g. 
Ive played a lot with grind and generally find that the best i can do is at around the 14-16 setting on Encore, medium fine with a 4-4:30 draw down, following the Rao method. Sometimes ive tried much coarser and went for a 3:30 draw down only to find the coffee too weak and sour.

My setup uses the Plastic V60 (Size 02), i use the appropriate sized filters, and I have Baratza Encore (which im considering upgrading with the M2 Burrs very soon out of suspicion that this all may be a grind quality issue). I have a gooseneck kettle too, and an appropriate scale. The only thing im not doing is using specialty water because i am living somewhere with very high water quality, and frankly i really dont want have to spend more money up keeping mineral water, buying plastic water bottles when i have filtered brita water already.

Finally, the coffee im using rotates between mostly quality specialty roasters in Canada, mostly purchasing single origin coffee from Pilot, Quietly, Lüna, Phil &amp; Seb etc.

The problem is that no matter what i do, theres a kind of dry, astringent note that always accompanies my coffees. The notes on the bag barely come through no matter how i manipulate the grind, and though i can sometimes get a pleasant, sweet balanced cup, it is not happening consistently enough, even if i don’t change any of the variables.

I wonder if my palette is just not very good. I have trouble tasting bitterness, and “over extraction ends up just giving me a dry mouth sensation, as if i was having a dry cup of red wine as opposed to giving me a burnt toast kind of sensation. The worst of this problem is that all my coffee has this uniform kind of unpleasant acidic note in the background, no matter the origin or the supposed notes on the bag. Im driving myself nuts trying to figure out what the problem could be.

As a final note, its not like i dont like specialty coffee or even acidic coffees. Though im picky, i have enjoyed plenty of coffees from local cafes, many of which ive tried making using the same beans at home with less than stellar results.

Thank you for your time and reading this rant lol.",1610375830

I've looked through this sub-reddit for some time but this is the first time I've posted. 

I'm UK based and while I've been finding my way into the coffee world I've largely stuck to what I know. Some of you may disprove but I've been using a French Pre-Ground blend from Aldi (supermarket) for around £1 for 227g  


I quite like this style but I'm hoping to get beans and venture into grinding them myself now. 

Does anyone have any suggestions based of this style of coffee or will it just be trial and error?

Espressos are excellent, however whenever i try to make a latte or cappuccino the taste is not as strong as the taste you get from coffee shop lattes?

Coffee,George-cz90,kuz2s8,[V60] swirling during bloom increasing total brew time,"I've been brewing by /u/kingseven's ultimate V60 technique for a while now and while it has been working out well for me so far, I've recently switched up my coffee a little and tried lighter roast (I prefer medium/lighter generally). For some reason I wasn't able to dial it in correctly, the brews just took soooo long, e.g. 15/250 dose up to 7,5 minutes and 30/500 up to 10!

I ofc tried to compensate this by making the grind coarser, but it made unsurprisingly low impact. (I usually grind 15-17 for 15/250, tried even going to 21 with no significant difference).

What I tried today was after pouring the initial 30g of water, I wouldn't stir but rather gently, but thoroughly mix everything up with a spoon. 

This led to the perfect brew time of 3:40 (on grind setting 15) and me being happy again!

I have owned a Keurig machine for about a decade and before I became an aspiring coffee snob, I LOVED it! 

Now that I’m grinding my own coffee and using an Aeropress, I can’t tolerate it at all. It tastes like water mixed with used and molded coffee grinds! 

About once a week, however, I don’t have time to go through the ritual and I’m forced to fire up the Keurig. I am forced to add oat milk, which hides the awfulness, but it’s still extremely unenjoyable. 

But... 

Keurig cups are vacuum sealed. This, in theory, could keep them more fresh than a pre-ground bag that sits in the supply chain for weeks or months before arriving to your kitchen. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that checks water temp that could, in theory, heat the water to exactly 205 degrees Fahrenheit- or whatever the best heat is. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that pours out the water. This could, in theory, pour at some scientifically proven best rate. 

So... why is Keurig so goddamn awful? Is there a super fancy one out there that accounts for all these factors? Am I sitting on a million dollar idea that I just gave away to complete strangers?

Coffee,davidb2002,kwc8vo,Trouble brewing with Salter EK3131,"Hi Guys,

I bought a Salter EK3131 a few months ago to replace my AeroPress as I wanted something that automated the process a little more. I wasn't expecting anything amazing for the price and expected that I would need to tweak to taste. However, I just can't quite seem to figure out where i'm going wrong.

I'm using the same beans Lavazza Espresso Italiano Coffee Beans and the same amount of beans ( the recommend amount for an Aeropress).  


With the Aeropress, the coffee was darker in colour and richer in flavour. The smell is usually rich and lovely like a coffee shop.  
With the Salter, the coffee is lighter in colour and taste more burny/bitter. The smell is also more bitter/burnt.   


I initially thought it was the grind, so I made it finer first, which seemed to increase the burn and started making it more course. It's still more fine than the Aeropress, and the taste has improved, but it still lacks flavour, lighter in colour and has a slight taste of bitter and water.  


Any suggestions thanks! I don't know if i'm putting to much water, beans or if the grind is off.",1610525878

From what I've read, the main differences seem to be flat vs conical burrs, slightly lower retention and easier grind adjustments on the niche.

And the convenience and ease-of-use goes to the Niche. However, I want to confirm if this is truly the case for individuals that may have done research or have owned both machines. If so, is the Niche Zero worth $250 more?

I’ve not actually used the grinder yet but would assume it still works as expected. I’ve emailed 1Zpresso who have advised that it’s not a common issue and it could be worth using a small amount of cooking oil on both parts - I’m slightly reluctant to do this because I think I’d have to do it fairly frequently, and I wouldn’t want it to impact the bean flavours.

Coffee,-gero-,kvxdb4,Better grind consistency on cheap hand grinders,"Just a quick tip I figured out last week that rapidly improved my cups. I own a Hario Skerton Plus and while it has a stabilizing plate built-in, I still find it yields pretty inconsistent results for coarser settings. 

Before, I always lifted it up and just turned the handle until it's finished. What I didn't know was how much the position in which you hold the handle affects the result. Holding it more upwards or downwards tilts the burr and makes some beans far too coarse while others end up far too fine. 

Now, I try to hold the handle as much in place as possible by dragging it outside, orthogonal to the grinder. I also find that turning it too slow or too fast makes it hard to keep the angle so there is a sweet spot that is probably different for everyone.

This technique particularly resulted in less filter clogging, presumably because there are less fine grounds, and has made my coffee routine much more enjoyable.

My question for you, are there similar tweaks that I might not be aware of to get the most out of cheaper hand grinders?",1610475943

So with that in mind, I’m looking for a grinder, either hand or electric, whichever I can get the best bang for my buck. My budget is around £100, but don’t mind stretching that a little bit, if it means I’m getting a far better product. 

I’m the only one in the house who drinks coffee, so I don’t need to grind huge amounts at once.

Coffee,redsunstar,kvvzhk,How often do you fail to entirely saturate the bloom by swirling (V60)?,"This is mostly a question about the mechanics of the swirl and what can affect it. 

I've noticed when I used the Hoffmann V60 method that it could be somewhat inconsistent. One of the reasons for that inconsistency was that sometimes the coffee bed failed to be entirely saturated during the bloom phase. Even after five to ten vigorous swirls, I could be left with coffee clinging to the filter, refusing to mix in an homogeneous slurry and some water sitting on top.

Here are some of the factors that impact this uneven saturation:

- Coffees that produce a lot of fines are more difficult to mix

- Coffee that is ground finer can be harder to saturate. These days I grind quite fine, so that's an issue for me. 

- Not swirling vigorously enough.

- Not pouring vigorously enough.

- The divot at the centre is not deep enough (grounds at the bottom don't get mixed in the slurry), the divot at the centre is too deep (water flows through too quickly)

- Excessively compacting some grinds while I'm making a divot. 

Once I have gotten to know how a specific bean behaves, it can be quite consistent, but I usually only stay with a bag a short while. So, because of that initial variability, I have switched to stirring like a mad lad with a teaspoon, that works well for me, takes care of my previous reproducibility issues and gives me delicious coffees.

Still, many people seem to prefer the swirl method taste wise. Have any of you dealt with unevenly saturated grounds during the bloom phase? How common or uncommon an issue is this for you? What factors have you found impact even saturation? How do you deal with it?",1610471985

The advice you get on this sub for some questions can be infuriating. Recently I've been trying to make my V60 cups brighter, so I searched posts with people asking the same question.

Is this normal?,"I purchased a 1ZPresso JX Pro back in October and I realised today while adjusting for a new coffee that the zero has slipped from 0 (it came properly zeroed from the factory) by about 2~ clicks and it now zeroes at 2 clicks past 9. The grind quality hasn’t been affected and I decided if I have to re-zero it, I may as well clean it. The burrs and everything else look immaculate so I’m not worried about any damage there. 

I’m just wondering if it’s normal for there to be slight slippage over time - I grind 30g of coffee a day and I’ve been doing so since October so the grinder is definitely seasoned. Cause for concern or am I overthinking this?

Now I got an aeropress because I got a coupon and thought to myself hell why not.

Simply amazing. 10 cups, 10 different recipes, 10 times a different product. Right this morning I made a cup that tasted like a very clean and rich French press cup. Recipe for anyone interested:

Regular method
250g 90°
40 second bloom with 60grams of water
Fill up to 250g
Stir once
Wait 90 seconds and press

Coffee,Lomandriendrel,kvhqnm,Breville barista express 870 - cleaned burrs,"Hi all

First time poster. Couldn't  find a post on this issue so wondering if it's  an easy fix. I recently got a barista  express 870 in december. After playing around abit after struggling  on getting timing right ive finally landed on a grind of around 2-3 that worked consistently with our coffee beans: using a single wall double filter i got about 8 secs preinfusions and a total of usually 28-33sec shots  (including pre infusion) which i presume is ""ok""? It was good enough for the mrs anyhow.  Come sunday i did my first clean of the burrs. Removed the top burr with the metal bar (gosh its hard to turn. Thought id snap the metal handle lifter) and used the brush to brush the inside and top burr of the coffee dust.   

Come today ive used it for the first time. Same beans. Never moved the grind dial. Got 6 secs pre infusion and an under extraxted pressure. Whole thing flushed  out in 18 secs or less. Thought id gotten too soft with the tamp but after doing 2 more attempts ive gotten similar results . Even under  tamping in the past ive not had this short of a time. I did feel the grind is suddenly more coarse and sand like.

Is it common to remove the burrs  and have the coarseness suddenly increase? Do i need to lock it into place  even  tighter (top burr - it's  in lock position but i found it quite hard to clockwise turn into this position) to revert it back to how it was grinding pre clean? Or is there some other setting when brush cleaning  i could have physically inadvertently  changed?

On another note  presuming i can get the grinding/ extraction back  to pre clean levels...any advice out of the 3 variables  to adjust: coffee grind, coffee quantity and tamping pressure - what do i change to lower pre infusion  time yet keep extraction post infusion   time the same? Ive found the only way pre infusion drops to 6s which is where some recommend (from my 8-9 secs) is when tamping lighter or less coffee but both result in a shorter extraction time. Tamping harder lengthens the extraction time naturally but bumps up the pre infusion time? Im struggling on how to get the 6 sec magical pre infusion window yet  still hit that 20-28 sec extraction  time people recommend? I just use the double espresso auto button (so no manual espresso).

Also my barista said to use a double walled filter  always but the manual  recommenda single wall as double wall is for pre ground etc? Curious  if barista or manual is right?

Coffee,muskogeee,lbpyvq,"Trying to up my coffee game, what am I doing wrong? Is it just cheap, bad, beans?","TL;DR: Can good coffee be made without spending $30+ on a 12oz bag of beans?

Lately I have decided to start taking my coffee more seriously.  Up until now I just bought whatever ground coffee was on sale, not the cheapest bottom of the barrel stuff like Maxwell House but things like Gevalia.

My first new purchase was a Baratza Encore, since it's my understanding that the grinder is the most important piece of equipment.

As for brewing, right now I just have a cheapo Mr. Coffee drip maker, a French press, and I cold brew occasionally.

My water comes from a well, is chlorinated in a contact tank, then filtered through a whole house filtration and softening system, then I have a 5 stage reverse osmosis under sink system for drinking water, so I doubt that's a problem.

All the coffee I've made in my new endeavor has just been mehh.  Bitter, acidic, and just doesn't taste like coffee or have the aroma of coffee.  I don't know if it's my technique, my grind settings, or what I suspect most, cheap, bad beans.

I've been watching a lot of coffee YouTubers, like James Hoffmann, but none of them ever seem to really talk about the beans they use, or whether or not you have to spend a fortune on beans to have good coffee.

So far I've tried Cafe Don Pablo, SF Bay, and Starbucks beans,  am I just wasting my time trying to go for ""budget"" beans?  even though many websites list them as the best affordable coffee and they are extremely highly rated on Amazon?  I like the coffee when I go to Starbucks, do they not actually use the beans they sell?  Do I really have to spend $30-$40 for a 12oz bag to get good coffee?

My main method is grinding 32g of beans at grind setting 26 on the Encore.  Preheating my French Press, blooming with 64g of 195 degree water for 45 seconds, adding the rest up to a total of 500g and steeping until I reach a total of 4 minutes, then gently plunging and pouring.

I really feel like just throwing some Maxwell House in the Mr. Coffee has given me better results, and filled the house with that unmistakable coffee fragrance, which all the beans I've tried just seem to lack.

Like I said, I'm sure it's the beans and my own fault for going ""budget"", but I really don't want to have to spend $50/lb on beans, so now I'm worried I've just wasted my money on a grinder.

Could someone recommend beans that are maybe in the middle?  I don't mind a little bitter or acidic but I just want coffee that tastes and smells like coffee.

Also, what kind of brewing method should I try next, V60, Chemex, Clever Dripper, etc.

BTW, I am in the US, Central Florida.

Thanks for the input!",1612366022

I'm slowly stepping into the world of coffee-making and today, trusting my italian roots, I bought my first moka pot. Now, I know that grinding your own beans is preferable to using pre-ground ones (from a perspective of taste if not of convenience). I gather the ""best"" grinder would be a really good electric burr grinder. Unfortunately, I don't have the money for that, so I'm stuck with deciding between a electric blade grinder and some decent hand grinder (I don't know which one yet, but I guess finding a decent and not too expensive hand grinder is feasible), which would be a burr grinder.
Not having any real experience with either option makes it difficult to make this decision. 
From your experience, do you have any advice for me? Do you think it's better using the electric blade grinder (I already have at home) or a decent hand grinder (if so, any specific recommendations?)?

Coffee,DapperBeancounter,lb6inh,"Chemex, finally!","Long-time lurker, but thought I would share with this awesome group! 

Have been using a French press for a few years - my go-to is actually Nespresso, but in the pandemic I started getting beans locally and brewing manually. Eventually got bored of it and decided to ""upgrade"". 

I decided on the Chemex. The idea of a clean and bright cup really appealed to me, and it seemed like the clean-up would be much easier. Debated between the Chemex and Aeropress since I am usually just brewing for myself or two of us at most, but settled on the Chemex. Not exactly sure why...

I made up my mind before trying to purchase. I'm in Canada, and it was actually really hard to find the Chemex in stock anywhere! Finally got my hands on one, but then the mission became getting filters. I found a place with them in stock in the US, had them shipped to the border and then picked up by a parcel forwarding company - to try and save cost I ended up ordering 4 boxes, so now I am definitely committed!

Had the chance to try it all out today and... it was awesome! The brew was really clean which was a very nice change from my usual French press. I think I lucked out with technique as it was my first time doing a pour-over. Looking forward to trying it out more, and upgrading my grinder next (currently using a hand grinder)!. 

Just thought I would share my experience!",1612300235
Coffee,kimbeezley,lb68y9,Recommendations for an office coffee machine? (help),"Hi all. My office previously had a Schaerer Joy automatic coffee machine which has served us well but has now truly died and needs to be replaced. I’ve been tasked with finding a new machine and wondered if anyone had any recommendations for good automatic coffee machines? It doesn’t need to have all the bells and whistles, we just need an automatic coffee machine that is quick, has an in built grinder, makes good coffee, and is a maximum of $5500 AUD. I thought some of the lovely people here might have some ideas of what’s good. For reference, the office is small - medium sized (our estimate is 150-200 cups a week based on our bean usage) and currently sits on a counter so we would want a machine that isn’t too huge. We also don’t need an in built milk frother/milk capabilities in the new machine as we have this function disabled on our current machine.

I love Starbucks nitro cold brew so have been experimenting with trying to make it myself to save some money. This has been a process so far, trial and error, and I’ve discovered that it is so far pretty difficult to exactly recreate the Starbucks nitro drink. Nitrous oxide or N2O slightly sweetens the coffee but adds a lot of dense bubbly foam (too much and not desirable IMO.) Nitrogen doesn’t sweeten it at all but makes for a much creamier mouth feel, no foam really but a creamy type topping. 

Through my internet travels I believe Starbucks is using a mixture of nitrogen and nitrous oxide, so my question for you guys is this, is it possible to use a mixture of both in a home brew kit? Or is that not possible without special equipment? I don’t want to combine two chemicals I’m not super familiar with and cause a bad reaction.",1612282847

I dial it in over 2 days and on the 2nd day I feel like I'm close to what I'm looking for, sweetness, some body and no astringent feeling. My first instinct is to change the coarseness of the grind to something finer as the coffee tastes somewhat empty. However, I choose not to.

Instead, on the third day, I simply run it through again, same procedure as I've done the 2 previous days. This time however, it tastes great. Sweet, with acidity but not overbearing, nice clarity and the taste lingers in the mouth instead of dissipating immediately.

I run on a Hario V60 Switch immersion dripper (I'm quite new to it) and I suspect that me allowing the water used to bloom to flow through led to part of the coffee being very under-extracted. Or it could be that my grinder simply had some residual grinds from the coarser setting. Who knows!

During the blooms phase which i used 50 grams of water for 15 grams of coffee i tried stirring, swirling and doing nothing at all. Rest of the brew was to aim 150 grams in the V60 until 1 min with circular pours and after that aiming for 250 grams until 1.30 with a center pour. After pouring a little swirl to the bed and let it drain.
Using the same grind setting taste profiles were very different.
The one with stirred bloom tasted more bitter compared the other ones.
The swirled bloom had some sort of an astringent taste and mole dulled out flavor notes but less bitterness than that of stirred and a little hint of sweetness.
The bloom with no agitation other than pouring had this juicy clear taste good aftertaste with long lasting sweetness but with a little less body.

TLDR : Different blooming techniques arises curiosity and results with some experiments.

What I'm asking here is that have you experienced something like this and how do you bloom your coffee?

2. I'm considering the Baratza Encore to get a more consistent grind and better coffee as a result. My thought process also includes automating the existing task. Am I right to expect a better or more consistent grind?

3. What do folks here recommend for their daily morning coffee? Do you use a drip style brewer, or stick to methods such as the French press or pour over? Are there brewers you recommend? What would even make one better than others in terms of the quality of coffee I get?

So this quarantine made me pick up v60 as a new obsession, and now i'm planning on buying a proper grinder instead of the handgrinder I have which is already a hard decision. At the same time I have my beloved barista express which I adore, but the problem is that its girnder is not comparable to a nische zero or anything at the same price range so most likely it will be sitting there unused. (i mean the grinder part)

So my question is, which espresso machine(around the same price range) would be a good replacement for the barista express. I was looking into stuff like the infuser but I live in europe so it is quite a stretch to get it here. My other candidate is the guaggia classic, but as I know it is quite a DIY machine which is not what i'm looking for atm.

I'd appreciate any recommendations. The problem is that i don't have the funds to both buy the grinder and a new espresso machine so i'd need to sell it second hand first.

Coffee,silent_femme,l9i2wi,"Thanks to James Hoffmann, my Nespresso game has vastly improved, lol, hear me out guys","So first off, I’m a long time member of this sub, and have learned so much about coffee because of you guys. Prior to joining this sub, all I knew about making coffee at home was the dosage to use: 2 TB ground, store bought, coffee to 6oz water. In this would go into my Mr Coffee coffee maker, and with a little flavored creamer and sugar, I had my morning coffee fix. 

Fast forward a few years later, I’m buying third wave coffee beans, I weaned off creamer and sugar and I’m drinking coffee black, bought a Comandante hand grinder, a digital scale, Fellow Stagg kettle, V60, Kalita Wave, French Press... I’m all in and in love with coffee. My morning coffee routines have become a ritual. I no longer drink it for its effects, I drink it because it tastes good.   

So prior to the pandemic, I would also frequent local coffee shops to drink the occasional cappuccino, Cortado, or just a double espresso after lunch, and my love for espresso started to grow just as quickly as my love for drip. Knowing how expensive an espresso setup would be at home, I decided not go that route and continue making pour-overs at home, and have my espresso at the cafes. 

Then once the pandemic hit, and coffee shops closed their doors, there was an emptiness inside me that I needed to fill, and that’s when I started researching espresso machine and watching James Hoffmann’s espresso guides, first one being on dosage. I didn’t want to go the capsule route, but I also didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole of espresso machines, because I just didn’t have the time, money, or real estate on my countertop for new coffee gear.   

So I settled on the Nespresso Essenza Mini because it was small, compact, made nothing but espresso, and they have a line of Single Origin coffees capsules, that also happen to be recyclable. Once I brought it home I “pulled” or made my first shot of Ethiopia and noticed it was weak and sour. At first this bummed me out, but then I remembered Hoffmann’s video about espresso dosage, and after reading the owner’s manual, I figure out I can adjust the amount of water that comes of my machine. So I grabbed my digital scale, did a little research of how much coffee is in each capsule, 8-10g, then made the necessary adjustments to the machine to pull a 2:1 shot. This also meant I had to use 2 capsules for a double shot, which means I’ll have to go through more capsules than I originally thought, but at this point I didn’t care, I just want to make this thing work. 

The shot was perfect. It had just the right amount of sweetness, body, and acidity you’d expect from good espresso. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best single origin espresso  I’ve drank from a coffee shop, and 5 being coffee chain espresso, I’d rank it at a solid 8. I was incredibly happy with the results, and given the circumstances we’re in, I’d rather have a quick shot of espresso at home in my demitasse, than drink it out of a to-go cup from a coffee shop. 

So thank you all for introducing me to this wonderful world of coffee, and I hope you all are enjoying a great cup of coffee, wherever you are in the world.",1612116798

Coffee,meowmeowjeff,l9fwjw,V60 - Drawdown time decreases with a finer grind?,"I've been brewing with a V60 for about a little over a month now. Mostly using the Hoffman technique. I've been pretty successful at it for the most part. Light roasts are a bit tricky to nail, but I've had some pretty great brews overall.

However, my most recent coffee purchase has left me utterly defeated. I can't seem to do anything right with it. It's almost like I completely forgot how to brew coffee. I don't understand. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I am at my wits end.

I'm following the Hoffman technique almost to the letter. This has worked for me brilliantly time and time again. I've found good success with using 2.5 rotations on my grinder as a starting point. Maybe a few clicks to really dial things in. Brewing \~1/16. Usually 32g coffee to 500g water.

So I grind my coffee and brew. Business as usual. That is, until my drawdown finishes at \~3:05. Coffee tasted very under extracted. I know the drill, two clicks finer, grind, brew. \~3:02. Rinse and repeat a couple more times, each time a little finer. Each time the drawdown is a little quicker. I have a flat coffee bed when all is said and done. No obvious signs of channeling. I just don't understand. Should the drawdown time not increase as the grind gets finer? This last brew seemed entirely too fine. About half a rotation finer than my typical grind setting.

Please help, I just want my morning coffee.

edit: Thanks for the feedback everyone. I should note that I'm mainly using drawdown time as a means to explain what is happening when I grind finer. Ultimately, each brew tastes very under extracted. I suspect this is due to drawdown time, as even when I grind finer it is still coming out under extracted.",1612111018
Coffee,lunaverse13,l9fp83,Breville 870XL: solenoid questions,"I have a 5 year old machine, and have researching posts and watching an exhausting number of videos, we’ve determined the issue is the solenoid (very loud buzzing, low pressure). The solenoid valve assembly that needs to be replaced is out of stock everywhere. There aren’t any parts available locally. I have a couple of questions moving forward:
1.  I’ve watched videos that recommended cleaning the solenoid valve assembly. Is it a matter of taking out the assembly and dismantling it before cleaning?  Some videos literally drop the entire assembly into a bowl of citric acid solution. 
2.  If that doesn’t work, and I have to purchase a new 3 way valve, how do I determine what to buy?  The OEM part is not anywhere to be found. How do I figure out which valve will work as a replacement? The stamped info on the valve is all Greek to me.

Coffee,MokaMaker,l9f3a2,Why are espresso machines so expensive?,"I’m looking to buy a single group head espresso machine for myself for at home use and maybe small functions.

Why is it necessary for a machine that simply heats up water, pushes out water at pressures and blows steam to cost me half a year of university fees? Then I haven’t even bought a grinder yet.

They buy a machine 5 years ago and then expect only a very minor price drop even though it’s 5 years old.

Sorry for the rant but it’s just so frustrating.

Coffee,jasonmaska,l93y3i,Advice Needed: Baratza Encore Grind Sizes for Chemex,"So, as it goes, I've had quite a bit of trouble dialing in the precise grind size for my chemex using my Baratza Encore.  I've been getting cups that have come out as sour, bitter, or a combination of sour and bitter.  I'm used to a crisp, acidic, citrusy smell coming from a chemex, like I would when walking into a coffee shop.  With my coffee grounds, it usually smells spicy and burnt.

I'm fully aware of the recommendation by the vendor to use the size 20 for chemex, but I've also heard wildly different suggestions.  Some videos have suggested sizes ranges of 16-19, others 20-22 and some even higher.  I've personally sent in my unit to be repaired to Baratza themselves to which they've recalibrated my grinder and suggested going even higher, to 25-30.  I've heard from the Onyx video to have a grind size similar to a size of a number on a penny -- which is one of the more elaborate descriptions.  A local coffee shop suggested the size of coarse sea salt.  I've also heard people say that everyone's Baratza could be slightly different and grind size will vary, etc.

Luckily, that same coffee shop I mentioned above was nice enough to give me some throwaway beans to use to dial in my grind size.  I've attached multiple photos a paper labeled with grind sizes 16 through 25 on my specific Baratza Encore.  I've realized while running my finger through the grounds that it seems like quite a few fine grounds get through on this grinder, and I'm not really sure what I can do to help it.

I've tried many different batches and recipes and just can't seem to hit it on the nail.  I used to brew with a strict 1:15 method using 40g of coffee and 600g of water; aiming for a 4:30-5 minute brew time.  I've been told to go with smaller batches, so I've been testing out 25g of coffee with 400g of water (1:16 method); a 3:15-3:30 brew time.  I've even tried out the large-batch onyx method of 55g of coffee with 900g of water; a 5:30-6:00, or up to 7:00 brew time.  For each method, I try to stick to a 0:45 bloom, but I'm not sure if that means I should be seeing constant bubbling in the grounds.  I'd say that if I only went with how much bubbling I see, it should be closer to 0:30.  Though there's a lot of methods out there and I've heard anywhere from 0:30 to 1:30. No matter what I try, I seem to have little luck.

Given my experiment, my eyes tell me to dial in around 22-24 on the encore, which would be around 22 for a 20-30g batch, 23 for a 30-40g batch or 24 for a 40g+ batch.  

I'm hoping for some advice on what's worked for you and what you think from the photos.  Anywhere from the best grind size, batch size, brew times, pouring methods, filters, water temperature, etc. is welcomed when it comes to Chemex.

It feels like I've tried everything and I'm at the point where I'm thinking that something in my house is significantly impacting the coffee flavor, to which I have no real basis on.  I just moved two years ago and felt like I've been able to make coffee fine before, but since I've been working from home during the pandemic, I've maybe just spent a lot of time diagnosing potential flaws here.  I've lived in a suburb 50 miles away and in a college town in central Illinois and had no issues there, and actually significantly better coffee.

As far as equipment goes, these are a few things I have at my disposal:

\- Bleached Chemex filters, but I also have natural brown filters

\- Electric kettle (typically at 205 degrees), using water through a brita filter (and my tap water comes from Chicago)

\- Baratza Encore

\- Lido 2 hand grinder (though I'm trying to dial in grind size better on the encore before experimenting with this again)

\- Third Wave Water packets &amp; Distilled Water, though I didn't notice any difference when I used this, so I've been sticking to the filtered water

\- Hario V60 Scale

\- Some fresh bags of coffee roasted a few days ago

But none of the grinders I've found say that you can remove the burr, and some even say that you never want to let any water get on it. I would worry about the flavor of stale coffee getting in the fresh coffee you're grinding that day--and if you ever want to add cardamom to your coffee, then all coffee thereafter would taste faintly of increasingly-stale cardamom. The obvious solution would be to just get a grinder with a removable and washable burr.

So the first thing I've been trying to master is a cappuccino, and I usually make 2 at once.

Usually the first cappuccino is the right consistency but I find that when I go to pour the second one, the milk doesn't seem frothed and tastes watery, as if I just poured in regular milk instead of frothed milk.

I tried transferring the milk from one jug to another to mix up the milk better but the same ends up happening. I've also tried sticking the frother in deeper after the first bit of frothing near the surface to make sure that the bottom milk gets frothed too but once again I get the same results.

I can't pretend I haven't found it incredibly hard.  I've had some good espresso, but mostly sour and acidic shots.  Doesn't help I like my coffee as Espresso, no milk or sugar to hide anything.

I'm wondering if the beans aren't helping me - I started with supermarket stuff to learn, got some fresh stuff from a London roaster gifted - but not what I'd choose and not really for espresso.  Then I tried a couple from Decadent Decaf - the espresso and sumatra.  Still fighting to get away from the sour/acid taste.

Can anyone recommend some reliable fresh Italian Espresso beans I can easily get in the UK so I can at least take the beans out of the equation in working out what's going wrong.  Ideally both normal and decaf.

My setup: Gaggia Classic Pro (fit the 9 bar mod today), Eureka Mignon Specialta grinder.  VST 15 and 18 g baskets (have been dosing at 14g in the 15g basket hoping that will increase the extraction and reduce the acid/sour).

From a price point, it  seems the GCP w/ OPV and PID mods will come out to be around $650 ($500  for the Thunder Black color GCP, $135 for PID, $15 for OPV kit), while  the CC1 v2 sits at around $699. For me personally, I don't think I'd  want to void the warranty on my GCP and tinker around with adding the  PID.

So when I found the CC1 v2,  which comes standard with features such as a PID and pre-infusion for a  similar price point, it made me wonder if this might be the better  machine for me. If you were in a similar position, I would be curious to  know which machine you would pick and why? Also I'm open to other  machine suggestions as well.

Now my question...

So, around a year ago I found this sub and dove into the world of coffee. I often saw Happy Mug and S&amp;W Roasting mentioned a lot so those have always been my go-to roasters and I couldn't be happier with their stuff.

I've always been eager to try different roasters like Vibrant, Onyx etc. but I just can't justify spending almost 3x the price for coffee 
when the stuff I'm brewing is already seemingly good.

Coffee,asoap,l8qt70,Is there a v60 paper that's more like a cloth filter? As in less of a filter.,"Let me explain. 

I just used a metal filter on my v60.  I knew it was going to give me more solids in my coffee and I really enjoyed it!  But it's a bit too much.  I want a bit of a middle ground between the metal filter which lets through a lot of solids and oils and a normal v60 paper.  My understanding is that middle ground is a cloth filter.  

Now I don't want the hassle that comes with a cloth filter.  I'm lazy.  I've actually been sitting on the metal filter for months because I didn't want the extra inconvenience of cleaning it.  

Is there any other options?  Like does anyone make a v60 paper that let's through more solids/oils?  Like a v60 paper that's perferatted?  Or perhaps a metal filter that's closer to a paper filter?",1612028102
Coffee,Mack_24,l8qexq,How to Fix Bland Coffee? (Coming from High Quality Beans),"So I've been brewing for about a month now, and pretty much all of my free time has been spent towards learning about coffee. Either by experimenting at home, or doing research online. 

This has led me to some great cups, but when it comes to brewing amazing cups constantly, I'm definitely not where I want to be. 

This being said, I just got a bag of Black and White's Gesha Village - Honey and I haven't been able to get the notes on the bag whatsoever. It is described as having notes of bergamot, dried mango, ripe papaya, and wildflower honey. But every brew has been fairly bland or uninspiring. This happened with a bag of The Future from B&amp;W as well.

I have dialed it in with grind size such that there is no bitterness or sour tastes. I know that bland can sometimes be a result of underextraction, but grinding one setting finer on my Encore with M2 burrs gives me some unwanted bitterness. 

Speaking of equipment, I'm using:
Baratza Encore with M2 burrs
Plastic v60 with brown v60 brand filters
198° Third Wave Water (that's the hottest I can get without boiling, here at 7000 ft elevation) 

And my method has been:
Preheat v60 and rinse filter, pour out rinse water,
20 grams of coffee in,
50 gram bloom for 45 seconds, briefly stirring with a spoon,
@0:45 concentric pour to 150g total,
@1:30 concentric pour to 250g total,
Once brew bed is just visible through the water pour to 310g total then a spin to even the grounds
Brew time has ended at about 3:30

I tried more agitation the last few times by pouring more quickly, and that has helped some, but I'm still not tasting the bright, delicious flavors that I want. 

How do I beat this bland brew?",1612027077
Coffee,rtice001,l8q53l,Help me find the unicorn Coffee,"Hello caffeine warriors. I'm in search of knowledge and the good folks at r/coffee_roasters sent me here.

A little over a year ago, my fiancé brought me back some coffee after vending at what we believe was the New York State Fair. I threw it in my grinder hopper and tossed the bag (you see where this is going).

Long story short, this stuff was nothing short of miraculous. Top three, if not top coffee I've ever made. I've searched quite a bit and have asked knowledgeable friends with no luck. Here's what I know:

1: The bag it came in was very pink, like maybe 70% pink with yellow accents. Very modern design on a high quality bag, similar in style to Partners Coffee bags. 10-12oz.

2: 90% sure it's a New York State coffee company and 70% sure it's not in the metro region.

3: They also made cans of coffee sold in 4-packs. Small cans, maybe 4-6oz.

The coffee wasn't called unicorn, I just used that word to describe my coffee muse.

At around the 15 month mark, I had a blowout in the gasket (one part of the gasket comes over the shower screen), and was occasionally experiencing water running over the portafilter into the cup directly. Without realizing that, I used it maybe 10-12 times wondering what was going wrong.   


I bought a new gasket, replaced it, and noticed the pressure was a little looser when locking the portafilter into the grouphead (i.e. it would turn further to the right, with less pressure). After around 2-3 months (now at 18 months), it started blowing out every time (and I would re-seat it, and it would blow out again).   


I bought a new gasket, and installed it, and now when I turn the portafilter there is absolutely no seal at all. I can turn it all the way to the end with a single finger with no resistance. It never locks. How does this happen? Has the grouphead plastic gotten loose from the previous blowouts putting too much pressure on it, widening it a few millimetres? Is there any fix for this?

I do this sitting at the computer, and suffice to say, that's not the best way to enjoy your hot drink haha, but it's been my routine regardless.

Really it just dawned on me that I could probably be saving myself from having to make the stuff 3 times a day, and also save myself from racing against the clock to finish the drink before it gets cold with just one change: getting a good Thermos.

So yeah, what are some of your favorite Thermos', and can you guys think of any that are suitable for my needs of making a batch of some hot drink early in the day, and just drinking from it at my desk for the rest of the day? I do have a traditional Glass mug that I could potentially pour from the Thermos into if you think that would be the best way to do it, but if I can drink straight from the Thermos that would be cool too.

* Something that holds 25-30+ oz or more would be ideal
* Needs to retain the heat throughout the day
* Great if I can drink straight from the Thermos
* Is there a such thing as a thermos that helps keep a drink ""mixed"" because I notice my hot Coco separates and needs stirring frequently
* I'll be sitting it on my desk at my computer, so ideally something that if it falls over won't risk a spill onto my keyboard etc haha

I won't be completing the work myself, as this is my first conversion so I'm hiring professionals. Also a Land Rover is a more expensive route, but it's a nostalgia thing more than anything. There's not enough space to stand in the back, so a hatch will be cut into the side of the car for the coffee machine/grinder etc. with the fridge in the back of the car. This leaves me more exposed to the elements, I'm planning on having an awning, but this is probably unlikely to give me much cover from the horizontal rain. I've worked on a farm for most of my life, so know what it's like to be outside in all seasons. I'm hoping that this experience will provide me with some mental and physical resilliance against the weather, but it is something I'm worried about. 

I still need to decide on a base and apply for relevant permits, but there is plenty of footfall in central Edinburgh so I'm confident I will find somewhere. I'll be selling good quality coffee &amp; cakes to start with, potentially increasing my products once I'm aware of my capabilities.

Coffee,ecm_confusika,l8aw37,ECM Synchronika w/ Flow Control sour???,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; espresso is sour, I have 4 questions-

1) **Do you recommend going up to 210 or does that indicate I'm doing something wrong?**

2) **Does higher pressure (i.e. 9 bars instead of 6) result in more or less sourness?**

3) **How does flow rate affect extraction? When sour, should I decrease or increase flow rate? How about when acidic?**

4) **How does channeling affect extraction? Does it have the ability to also make a coffee sour or just acidic?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making espresso for 7 years on a Breville Barista Express and have finally gotten my next upgrade. My machine is an ECM Synchronika with Flow Control, and my grinder is a Ceado E37S. I have had these machines for 2 months now and it sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

This evening I spent another 2 hours going through about every video I could find, and 3 pounds of fresh coffee. The beans I used this evening were roasted on the 27th of January (just two days ago). Every single shot I pulled was sour. I will upload an image for your entertainment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need someone's help with this, and I'm not a reddit regular but I'm hoping you guys have some experience to help me out here. I'm sure there is something I am missing, I have never even touched a machine this nice so there's probably something stupid going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**ECM**

I moved the temperature up to 210 Fahrenheit, and that seems to have helped but it's unusual to have to go that high. My Breville only needed to be raised \~+/- 2 degrees from 198 and was not this sour using the same water. My **first question is Do you recommend going up to 210 or does that indicate I'm doing something wrong?** I have backflushed the ECM using Cafiza powder. Keep in mind this is a brand new machine though (not even refurbished). The water I am using is filtered, via a Brita filter. The portafilter is hot, the boiler shows it's reaching pressure (9 bars), and with flow control I can even see that the group head is also reaching 9 bars. **My second question is Does higher pressure result in more or less sourness?** I also tried playing around with no flow control, flow control etc. I left the flow control device open 1/4 revolution for 5 seconds, then opened by 1 full revolution. I did the same with the device open 1/4 for 10, then 1 revolution. Irrespective of flow control settings, I taste the coffee with my finger when it's coming out in the cup in those initial stages and it's sour. Needless to say the cups are also sour. **Third question is How does flow rate affect extraction?** Different flow rates can yield the same pressure. That is to say that with 1 revolution I can get 9 bars, heck even with 1/4 a revolution I can hit 9 bars if it's too fine a grind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**E37 S** 

The E37S does not evenly distribute grinds. I'm surprised nobody has published anything about this but I will share a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0c2zBYYvX4) from a fellow poor soul. I am following his technique but don't yet have a distributor or bottomless portafilter (coming in soon) to make sure I am evenly distributed. I eyeball it and it looks like one side is higher than the other by a bit. I am hesitant to tamp again, and seldomly get even distributions with the E37s.  My **fourth question How does channeling affect extraction?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Beans**

Could this just be it? Why sell beans that aren't ready? How long should I actually wait? What beans should I buy? What beans are not fucking sour? What beans are good? Plz help",1611971747

I just got an espresso machine upgrade and the whole extraction process seems off, but I’ve run out of ideas as to what I could be doing wrong. Here is what I’m seeing during my extraction process:

1. The puck always has a dent right in the middle because there’s a screw right in the middle of the group head screen and I’m not sure if it’s normal to have that. I’ve tried a 20g filter basket and a 21g filter basket with a 20g dose and I see it in both of them... Am I just not tamping hard enough or should I be dosing less? Or would the dent not really affect my shot much?

2. During the extraction, the stream of espresso seems to come out towards the front, as opposed to being in the middle. This signals an uneven extraction to me, which intuitively tells me maybe my tamping is off? I’ve tried it with a distribution tool with and without tamping and it doesn’t seem to do much. My thought was that using only a distribution tool would probably give me a more even extraction if my tamping technique is off. This leads me to my 3rd question:

3. After each extraction, there’s always residue towards the bottom of the filter basket. Not sure what to make of that - probably a result of an uneven extraction?

I’ve uploaded some pictures of the portafilter below so you can see what I’m talking about.

The doc whittled through a list of things I consume that could be causing it, and he specifically said whole-bean/ground coffee, not the crappy stuff in a jar at the supermarket but the proper stuff. Apparently ground and whole bean coffee, the latter especially, is high in cholesterol when consumed in larger quantities (2/3 cups a day, which is about what I have).

Has anyone else heard of this?",1611930677

Coffee,PartyAtTheMoon-Tower,llf4cq,Using third wave water? Having trouble getting good cups? Halve your mineral dose.,"So I've been struggling with my coffee for quite some time. Some of you may even recognize me from previous posts where I seek help, and am completely baffled why I couldn't achieve the same results as many of you. I have top of the line equipment, years of experience with honing my pour technique, etc. Simply put: I'm no expert, but I should be getting SOME kind of results.

Well, recently I caught wind of a few convos across reddit regarding third wave water. It's something I've used for several years, and have never really given it much thought. After all, all I hear is how optimized it is, and if there are problems with my cups, it's likely my technique, the beans, etc.

Basically, some people mentioned that they felt Third Wave Water creates a water profile that is pretty hard (I want to say 150ppm?). They felt the mineral supplement created harsh, chalky or flat cups. ""Hey! That sounds like my cups."" I thought. I've been having cups with a borderline umami profile for a while now. No aroma. Not much at all really. Occasionally I'd luck out and hit the sweet spot at coarser grinds, but not often.

I own a REMI grinder, and couldn't figure out why the grind reccs felt too fine for me. They created such sludgy cups. Coarse tasted better, but also felt weak. Well, per some recommendations I halved my third wave water dose.

WOW. What an incredible difference.

I waited to post this until I made sure I wasn't crazy. Across 6 coffees, different regions and roasters, my cups have been beautiful. Floral, aromatic, bright, sweet, etc. I can taste all of the flavors on the bag, and more than that. All because my water isn't as hard. I'm getting the benefit of third wave water without the full strength of it. This perfectly explains why I always looked back several years ago, and wondered why I had better cups then? Well, my water probably wasn't as hard!

Anyway, I figure someone reading this might be struggling too. If you are used Third Wave Water, consider halving your dose. Two gallons for 1 packet. That may be the fix you need. Plus, it's cheaper in the long run!",1613513728
Coffee,loodog555,llen1f,I just read through all the physics papers about Moka posts I could get my hands on and here's what I found:,"Basically, there are 4 physics papers that address how Moka pots work:

A 2002 paper (in Italian!) by Varlamov and Balestrino, which a later paper (2009 Navarini) calls wrong.

A 2006 paper by Gianino (who I corresponded with to create this video, which has it origins in a high school project)

A 2008 paper by King (who I also corresponded with)

2009 paper by Navarini et. al (who has not replied).

The big take-home message is that the pressure the air contributes significantly changes the dynamics of how the thing works compared to vapor pressure of the water alone. The big surprise is that it lowers the pressure and so delays the brewing, which is a good thing, because otherwise your coffee brews at too low a temperature to extract properly.

Main points:

1. a moka pot does *not* in general brew by boiling water

2. preheated water &gt; cold water because the coffee will extract at too low a temperature if you don't preheat

3. how much you fill up the pot affects the brewing as well, with more initial water causing a delay in brewing until pot reaches higher temperature, which is why you should always fill up to the fill valve.

Any questions about this, you can post here and I will reply, but I also made a [video on my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl4K1no9gh8) which summarizes in pictures and stuff. 

I hope I'm following sub rules this time around.  Sorry if not!",1613512355

Coffee,juliusklaas,lld3dp,Does the perfect espresso machine exist?,"First of all, I get the artisan process of making a good espresso (only coffee I really care about). But I only care bout the end product. I’m thinking about getting something like an Eureka Mignon Silenzio mill (500) and a Rocket Chronometre R Mozzafiato (2300) plumbed into filtered main water supply and drain. This would give me a lot of flexibility, and if you see it as a hobby, one could probably make world class espresso with this setup without a lot of hassle, given you have good coffee.

My parents have a full auto machine at home (some medium level Jura). The espresso is not great. I’ve had good coffee from fully automated machines, but never as good as the best handmade. As someone with a mechanical engineering background, I refuse the idea that one cannot build a full-auto machine that makes the perfect espresso.

I thought it was so weird because everyone expressed how “wired” they would feel after a cup of Joe, and the stereotype of it waking you up, just wasn’t what I was experiencing. But then learned from my doctor that it may have a calming affect on those with ADHD because of the stimulant calming the hyperactivity.

Coffee,SomeoneLeo,ll2pmy,Aeropress smells and tastes like burned rubber,"Hey, I have my AeroPress for a couple of years now, but during the past weeks it developed an issue, where the coffee I brew with it smells and tastes like burned rubber. Not a bit, like, really, really disgusting and undrinkable. I did not move to a new place and I did not change my recipe. I also tasted the water cold and hot before tasting it, it tasted good. Also the water from rinsing the paper - no bad taste there either. The weird thing is, that this doesn't always happen. I put the plunger into the dishwasher now since I suspect the rubber to be the issue and the first coffee I made with it tasted perfectly fine (I rinsed the parts afterwards with hot water), but the coffee on the next day smelled and tasted absolutely disgusting again. Next time I washed the rubber with hot water and soap before using it, but I still got an undrinkable cup.

Coffee,creamyhorror,lkzfpc,"Taste of coffee degrades noticeably if left exposed to air, in just 30 min?","I've noticed that when I reduce my brewed coffee's exposure to fresh air, it stays tasty for much longer. I put an airtight silicone lid on my cup that stops almost all air exchange with the outside.

If I leave it uncovered, in just 30 minutes, it turns noticeably more bitter (and sour) and loses a lot of complex and tasty flavours. After an hour or two it tastes outright unpleasant (horribly bitter). The effect is slowed if the volume of coffee is large, e.g. a batch in a carafe, presumably since there's less surface area exposed to air.

I noticed this over the weekend when an uncle visited and I made coffee for us. I covered my cup while he left his uncovered for 30 min while having dinner, and mine was still tasty while he remarked that his tasted a lot worse after dinner.

Anyone else notice this and always cover their coffee? Or am I imagining it?

Here is what I'm using:

* Coffee - Philz Philtered Soul (medium, slightly oily roast)
* OXO Conical Burr Grinder
* Chemex &amp; Chemex filters
* Gooseneck Kettle (no temp control)

Here is my base method:

1. Filter tap water through Brita &amp; bring to boil in kettle
2. Grind 20g of coffee to medium coarseness (8 on scale of 1-15)
3. Wet Chemex filter with hot tap water &amp; put grounds in
4. Wait 30 seconds post-boil for water to cool
5. Bloom grounds with 45g water for 30 seconds, agitate any dry sports
6. Pour the total of 340g water (17:1 ratio) in slowly and in circular motion
7. Swirl around every two minutes until done

I'm planning on buying a brewer and wondering which of the three Kalita wave 155, Kalita Tsubame 155, Fellow Stagg X would be a good option. I have the following questions on this:

Is Kalita Tsubame 155 better than Kalita wave 155? Is the extra price worth it?

I understand that the Fellow Stagg X is a lot more forgiving than Kalita because of its narrow shape and would it not negate the total coffee brewing experience for someone who is obsessed with the process? In that aspect is Kalita better than Stagg X or is my understanding totally wrong?",1613419947

Coffee,ghantazbells,lkk9le,Finally figured out the Moka Pot,"I don’t know if this is common knowledge but the common Moka pot technique of filling the the basket all the way and filling hot/boiling water up to the valve do NOT yield the best results. I never managed to make a great cup by doing so. I mean they were really good but never great. I read somewhere that the coffee:water ratio should be 1:11. For my pot, the coffee amount was almost the absolute limit of the basket (about 14 grams in my 3-cup pot). On a whim I measured the amount of water that was always left behind in the boiler after a brew, subtracted that from the total amount I put in (up to the valve) and THEN calculated the amount of coffee required. Turns out it should be around 11 grams (at level 10 on my encore) and the difference in taste is night and day. To all of you still struggling with your moka pot, just try calculating your coffee amounts in this way. Just remember to stop the brew the moment it even feels like the pot is about to sputter.

Coffee,Mottotta,lkk1si,UK based and looking to take my first steps into home espresso,"I’m looking to buy my first espresso machine for my home, will be used for a mixture of espresso and milk drinks, but probably only light use - maybe one or two uses a day max. Current grinder is a wilfa uniform (though will likely upgrade to a niche zero eventually). 

I’m looking to spend around £500 and have considered the following so far

Lelit grace - PID and pressure gauge, looks like it would be able to manage my light workload but drawback is the 57mm portafilter 

Lelit Victoria - as above but has a 58mm portafilter unfortunately probably stretching out of budget and very hard to source reliably in the UK. 

Rancilio Silvia - would want to add a PID which looks fairly time intensive and I’m also fairly clumsy 

La Pavoni casabar PID - has a PID and a pressure gauge but probably at the top of the price I’d want to pay. 

I’m not massively keen on buying secondhand and I think the dream machine would be a DE1 but I’m way out of that price range haha.

This is my first time visiting the subreddit, and I’d like to start by saying hello to the coffee fanatics of reddit.

I do not want to drink decaf coffee, as I do like the effects of caffeine. But I was looking for someone to suggest a whole bean coffee that is naturally lower in caffeine so I can still get the pleasant effects of caffeine but without getting the unpleasant effects of being overly caffeinated. I typically use a pour over for brewing if that helps.

After three machines had issues after few weeks (always another one), we gave it back and tried the Philips 3200 LatteGo, but the milk frother solution is not well thought through in our opinion. So this one went back as well.

As my wife has been drinking less Latte Macciattos recently, the idea is now to go back to a more traditional coffee machine.

I spent this Valentine's Day and this following morning installing the M2 burrs (from the Virtuoso and Precision) into my Encore - as some of you have done on here.

I actually had a lot of trouble installing it. There are some good videos out there showing the process, but I felt something was wrong on the first grind. Grinding at the same setting (11) from before the upgrade produced much coarser grinds. The brew tasted off, but I thought the burrs just needed to be broken in.

I tried making a cup this morning and I just got frustrated that I spent money and time trying to ""upgrade"" my Encore, and I was getting worse cups. So I Googled it and, as I suspected, I reinstalled the washers wrong. There are these little metal rings, 6 of them in total in 3 different sizes. And it turns out, you have to put them in the right order or else the grind will be off! I reinstalled it earlier this morning and it turned out better, but then I realized, I got the order wrong again! So I reinstalled it again! All in all, I spent about 2 hours yesterday learning how to take it apart and reinstall it again and then all of the cleanup, and then about 30 min for each reinstall attempt this morning (I remembered much of the steps from last night).

Was the upgrade worth it? Honestly, I don't know. Now that everything is fixed and the grind seems right, it produced a great cup! But not drastically different, but I'll have to check back in in a few weeks when I've had time to try the burrs more. The consistency of the grind by eye was much better with less fines. One surprising benefit I noticed: less channeling! 

But the whole process of taking it apart, installing it, and putting it back together was much more difficult than I thought and I didn't expect that these little thin rings would screw up everything. If I didn't have spare time and the patience to tinker with it, I would definitely be frustrated and say it wasn't worth it. But I love my coffee and I'm happy taking time to care, especially if my cups taste better from here on out!

[If you're going to upgrade your burrs, please use this PDF from Baratza to figure out the washer situation!](https://www.baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Washer-Guide-Conical-Grinders-1.pdf) It'll save you from a lot of frustration.

[Cabeen's Coffee Corner's video guide is your best friend in helping you through this process.](https://youtu.be/vxbaS8UXCpk)

There are a few other videos on YouTube that will help. [Baratza's video on installing the GB 2.0 Kit on the Preciso can also help, just because the inner parts are roughly the same as the Encore](https://youtu.be/RCa_wReQl9A) (but don't rely on this video as much because it isn't the exact same as the Encore).

Coffee,czar_el,lkg0rb,Immersion w/ Paper Filter,"I've been a longtime french press lover, who went back to pour over in the last few years due in part to wanting to test all the new techniques and in part due to recent science about coffee oils being unhealthy (quick primer: they are associated with elevated cholesterol according to a recent meta-analysis, but can be removed w/ paper filter methods). Also, understanding the physics of brew extraction (and comments from experts like Hoffman), it makes total sense that immersion is better for even &amp; complete extraction. 

That leads me to immersion methods with a paper filter component as a great compromise between the points above. I know the Clever brewer is popular for that reason, but I don't like plastic vessels for dealing with hot water (yes, they're BPA-free, but there  are so many understudied components in plastics, it's only a matter of time IMO before the next as-yet-undiscovered BPA-like human health impact is identified). So, I decided to replicate Clever directly in my mug.

I experimented with just lining my mug with a pre-washed paper filter, making sure my coffee-water ratio was right for that particular mug size, and manually pulling the filter and grounds out when brewing was done (letting the remaining water in the grounds drain for 30 secs over the mug). ***It was delicious!*** And cleanup really wasn't hard at all, nor did I burn my fingers as I was afraid I might.

(It's a real nice coffee and tastes just like white chocolate!) I'm curious to try 4:6 with the same coffee this afternoon, but I have my reservations. For this particular coffee, I tend to grind pretty damn fine à la Hoff's recommendation (2 notches from zero on the Skerton if that means anything), and even then, the drawdown for this coffee is super quick, usually ending just shy of three minutes at that grind setting. Now Kasuya-san advocates grinding at around a French Press type grind, which just seems mind-blowing to me, but I hear so many good things about the 4:6 method producing an almost foolproof cup of coffee, so I'm really interested to try it out.

Coffee,CUTookMyGrades,ljuzjf,Discovering Cold Brew Coffee has been a complete game changer.,"So I was a bit of an Iced Coffee addict, where I would UberEats food just so I didn’t have to go out in the cold to get Iced Coffee...yeah huge waste of money.


I saw that Cold Brew coffee was a thing so I ordered it one time to see what it was like vs Iced Coffee and WOW. It was so smooth and being cold without ice was a huge plus.


So I bought a Cold Brew maker on Amazon, and I literally haven’t bought Iced Coffee (and fast food in general lol) in two weeks! It’s saved me so much money and it tastes so good.


Also, I take medication for ADHD so I have to control my caffeine intake. So i would (stupidly) skip my meds so I could drink Iced Coffee. But now I can make Decaf Cold Brew! So I’ve been doing that.


So in short Cold Brew coffee has allowed me to save money AND drastically improved my mental health since I take my medication consistently and still get my coffee fix 😅


My next step is going to be to buy whole coffee beans and grind them myself, since now I’m just buying  bags of grinded coffee from the store.",1613329868

I've been a lurker and Drip fanatic for the past year or so and finally got an espresso machine after years of not having one. 

I'm having an issue with the GCP pulling shots WAAAAY too fast. I've been dosing 18g double shots in the pressurized basket and getting 27g of espresso in like 7-10 seconds.

Coffee,PointNChris,ljr27k,Troubleshoot Holler Mtn in French Press?,"So I would consider myself relatively novice when it comes to “high end” coffee making or advanced stuff. I drink a lot of coffee but I don’t know much about really nice coffee or advanced technique.

I picked up some Stumptown Holler Mtn (never had any, just chose this blend first for fun) after hearing some people talk about it. French press is like the nicest method I have of making coffee at the moment. 

I’m currently on my second attempt at this particular blend and there’s something odd about it to me.. I don’t think it’s the coffee but I’m trying to get it dialed in. Note: I’ve made French press before with other blends that I thought came out well. 

Here’s my process maybe you guys can help me figure out what’s up:

Grind size 14 on a cuisinart conical burr (I know it’s not the best but it’s what I have). This is the second notch on the “French press” settings. Tried 16 first time and it was pretty bad and weak. 14 worked fairly well for some random other blend the other day so I started here.

Filtered water into kettle, let it sit to 204 degrees.

Poured half way to bloom grinds, 1 min, broke it up, filled the rest up and went 3 min then pressed.

I guess sour is the best description? I realize now maybe I don’t know the difference between sour and bitter lol.  I know the bag says it has a citrusy note to it but it’s almost like someone just squirted lemon juice into my coffee. I feel like I’m doing something wrong here....

Also I drink coffee black, not a big cream guy but maybe this coffee isn’t meant for that? Most likely I’m just messing something up./u/",1613318648

Coffee,Binary101010,ljd7zf,Ready to upgrade grinder for brew but unsure about options,"I recently started brewing with a V60 and it's become increasingly clear that my OXO burr grinder is becoming the most frustrating part of my coffee experience. It can't even get through 24g in 30 seconds (so I have to press the button more than once), there's retention of 1g+, it's uneven, I'm just not enjoying it. So I'm looking to spend some cash on a better grinder, but the problem is that the discussion seems to jump from the \~$150 range (Encore) to the super-high end ($1K+) and not much near the upper end of my budget.

Some specifics about my situation:

Location: US (So by my understanding this largely disqualifies Wilfa products)

Budget: Up to $400USD before the missus starts asking questions

Brew type: Primarily V60 with dark and medium roasts, followed by french press with same. No real interest in trying to do espresso at home in the foreseeable future.

Grind volume: Single-dosing  24g or 30g at a time. I might do up to 42g if I want to totally fill my french press but I can't really see ever needing more than that at once.

Willingness to mod: Minimal. I'm at the point where I'd really rather just have the best thing I can get out of the box without having to futz with it too much (especially if we're talking voiding the warranty).

I'd been looking seriously at the Ode but all the reviews I seem to watch of it have some weird kind of off-putting vibes leading me to question if it's worth spending double what an Encore would cost.

So is there something in that \~$300-$400 range that I'm missing? Or will I really be just as happy for my situation with an Encore and an extra $250 in my bank account?

Coffee,ApostropheJ,lj666n,I'm Probably Doing This Wrong,"Let me start off by bragging that I went to black coffee three years ago and haven't looked back. I was a creamer ADDICT but now, creamer nauseates me.

I can only handle cold brew. Hot coffee upsets my stomach and when hot turns to room temperature, it's just foul. 

What I probably do wrong:

1. I don't mess with ratios. I just add my coarse grounds into the French press and add water. I do refrigerate for 8-10 hours.
2. I don't pay attention to ""notes"" of flavors and the science behind it. I just like what I like. I buy medium or medium to dark roasts. 
3. I don't dilute it with extra water or ice. I just pour and go. I personally like it this way, others who try my coffee say it's WAY too strong. I like it so thick, I can chew it. I don't do sissy coffee.

I have debated buying a scale and weighing the grounds before I add but why? I have become picky with my beans. I don't buy Starbucks beans (EW! And they make me physically sick). There's a local shop about 20 miles away that sells extremely wonderful roasts. I spend close to $130/month on beans. 

I grind coarse with a regular grinder, pour them into my 32 oz. French press, add water to just below the lip, cover with Saran wrap, refrigerate overnight, then pour and go. I like the taste even though others prefer theirs with ice and added water.",1613241158

My hope is that when every batch runs through the burr, it strips away some of the older residues, so every a few batches can refresh the oldest residues.

I never smelled or tasted anything unpleasant so far.

I bought a metal filter for my chemex for convenience since I live in a dorm and I feel as if it's messing with my brew process because it drains very fast. 

This is my process: 21g coffee to 350g water, ground a little finer than normal pourover probably in a JX pro. Water fresh off the boil, 50g water and 30 second bloom. Then 180g pour, wait 30 seconds. Then 120g pour, give it a stir, then finished. I took these intervals from James Hoffman, but I think having a metal filter completely throws them off; after the 30 seconds of each cycle all the coffee is already drained. The coffee I get is still pretty good, but it feels like it's missing something and I enjoy my french press cups more.

I have a Breville/Sage barista pro. I generally just adjust grind size to try to get from roughly 8-30 seconds of espresso with generally good results. 

Recently I had a coffee go from good to great after increasing the grind time by a second. Up until now I’ve mainly just kept a consistent level of grounds regardless of bean and just adjust if that looks a bit low or too full. 

I think I have a good grasp on the sour under extracted taste and the bitter over extracted taste, but have only used the grind size to correct there. 

Should I be adjusting the amount of grounds more and what should inform that setting?

Also with all these variables how do I get a bean dialed in before half the bag is used?!

My water temp is constant throughout the brewing process, 208-210°F, and I pre-warm all my drippers with boiling water, but I’m guessing  because of the ceramic’s heat retention, the water cools down a lot quicker and doesn’t pre-heat the carafe with hot enough water to keep the brewed coffee at an optimal drinking temp.

Coffee,nelldog,lwr3z9,A large batch aeropress recipe that I wanted to share.,"Hi all just wanted to share with you a larger batch technique I've been using that's been working really well.

Dose: 30g

Grind: Medium (On the Wilfa Svart I have it set to the A or Aeropress if that helps)

Aeropress: Standard configuration

Brew time: 2 minutes.

(Hotel: Trivago)

Technique:

1. After all the rinsing and preheating has been done to both aeropress and carafe. Add first 50g of just off the boil water, and stir for 10 seconds.
2. Add a further 150g of water and put the plunger on, lifting it slightly to create suction and stoping any coffee from dripping.
3. Leave to brew for 90 seconds.
4. After 90 seconds, take plunger off and break crust on top with the back of a spoon.
5. Place plunger and...well plunge. My timing have been around 10 seconds for this.
6. This should yield around 160g of coffee concentrate, add to this 200-250g of water with the aim of bringing the over all liquid amount to 400g.
7. Swirl, pour, let cool and enjoy.

Pretty simple but has been really effective and has made me fall in love with my Aeropress all over again. Let me know what you think and even share how you've been brewing.",1614768857

I get that coffee purists dont rate Philz on the upper tier since it's seems like their popularity is derived from their heavy cream/sugar based options which I've tried and admit are delicious but im health conscious so I prefer my coffee black with a bit of cream.  Lots of coffee purists also infer that Philz uses a a heavy manufacturing cream and blend of 2nd rate coffee beans etc. 

     It seems like a common recommendation is Blue bottle etc.  I live in LA and was just wondering if anyone can point me out to a retail coffee vendor that replicates this Philz Tesora but better? I've sampled some of the brands that coffee purists praise but I dont like bitter or acidic coffee but love the carmel chocolate nutty taste profile of Philz Tesora!  Obviously I don't really know how much of this is coming from the heavy cream which I choose the light option which settles on the top.

I brew appox 50g to 900ml every morning for the wife and I. The amount of coffee I make only changes when we have guests and I have to make multiple batches. I hardly ever make less. 

With this said I would love to get into espresso as we just got our plumbing re-done and there is a spot for the future espresso machine to be plumbed into. Now when I purchase the espresso machine it will probably be 6 months out, so the simple pour over is still in play over here. 

I have been looking at all sorts of grinders for so long, and well I kinda have it narrowed down, but I wanted to ask a question I have had a hard time finding the answer to. Would it be crazy to just buy a Eureka Specialita now and use it specifically for pour over? I would not be going back and forth between grind settings and just be using it for pour-over. That is until the espresso machine comes. Then I will just use the Specialita for espresso and probably end up buying an Encore or Lido for my occasional pour-overs that I know I will still make. I understand the Specialita is made for espresso and will produce fines, but would it be okay to use soley for pour-over until the time comes and it graduates into espressohood? Or would my money be better spent getting something like say, an encore or ode now? I kinda want to jump on getting the Specialita now but I wanted to hear some opinions if anyone has used it for brewing coffee regularly. TIA",1614728385

Coffee,Jaywalkas,lw85re,Bad Experience With Whole Latte Love,"  

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share my experience with WLL to maybe warn others going into this as well as maybe to help commiserate with others who've maybe had similar experiences .As I write this review/summary of my experience I will try to stay as objective as possible despite my frustrations.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I (both former baristas at one point in our life) decided that it’s a good time for us to get our own espresso machine for home. Originally our budget was set at around $200 but after doing a ton of research and considering what we want in a machine we bumped that up to around $300 ($330 was the final price) to put us in reach of a refurbished Gaggia Classic. It checked all of the boxes for us: non-pressurized portafilter, ability to use pods, ability to customize and upgrade in the future, etc. I spent some time waiting for either a refurbished Classic or Classic Pro in our price range to hit the market through either Amazon Warehouse or Whole Latte Love. WLL was the first to put one up for offer and I jumped on it. Order went through on Feb 4th. It arrived Feb 11th and during that time we ordered beans from our favorite roaster in Seattle and had them shipped in (we live fairly rural in the Cascade Mountains), purchased shot glasses, milk (we don’t really keep milk in house), oatmilk, espresso pods, and a frothing pitcher. We’re ready (yes, a nice grinder would have been next on the list).

&amp;#x200B;

I unpack the machine and start putting it together. I know it’s a refurb but I’m fairly disappointed in some of the rusty or calcified components, especially ones that could/should have been easily replaced (looking at you rusty screws!) during the refurbishing process. The rust on the body is understandably harder to remove. Ignoring this I continue to put it together and try it out. Steam works okay and pump primes but nearly no water flows through the brew assembly. I get about 1oz after a minute thirty seconds. I take apart the brew assembly and it’s dirty, screws are calcified, but screen looks good even though it’s worn a bit and there doesn’t seem to be any obstructions. Take the top off and look for anything loose or out of place. All good. Just no water really from the brew group. Can’t make espresso. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I call customer service on Feb 12th, the tech sends out a blind portafilter and Cafiza so I can back flush the brew group on the 15th. It arrives on the 24th. My poor beans. I immediately set everything back up and start backflushing the unit. Still minimal water flow. I continue backflushing and checking for nearly an hour with no improvement. Done.

&amp;#x200B;

Customer service call again on Feb 24th. They tell me there’s a replacement machine on hold but the senior tech wants to reach out to me in a day or two to see if there’s any last ditch effort to be made before replacing the machine and I should expect an email or call in around 24-48 hours. Nothing. No attempt on their part to reach out to me until I call back on March 1st. Apparently there’s no record of a work ticket for the senior tech to reach out to me even though that was their idea. I am very frustrated at this point and it’s been nearly a month since I ordered. I tell the rep that I would like to just exchange it at this point. They talk it over with their manager and tell me that there is actually no machine available to exchange and that my only options are to send it back for a refund or to fix it myself. So I will now be spending more of my time packing it up and sending it back and waiting for a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I will not be reimbursed for my time trying to do the service tech’s job. I ordered a working product. It is not my job to fix a product that was supposed to arrive in working order. If I wanted to take a gamble on a product I would have bought it from a garage sale and spent half as much. If I wanted a project I would have gone to Ebay and bought one that needed fixing for half as much. I went to Whole Latte Love because they are supposed to be a reputable company and I expected a working product. I expected that I would be covered in the event that this product did not work. I am not a repair technician for Whole Latte Love and it’s unfair to ship me a product that doesn’t work and expect me to be a repair technician for Whole Latte Love and not get paid for it. It’s unfair and frustrating for me as a consumer. This is a failure to deliver a working product and a failure to rectify the situation.

Coffee,FrPatNoise,lw648d,Ceramic v 60 stalling,"I'm using a Wilfa Svart with a bunch of different brewers, and have noticed the two-cup ceramic v 60 I recently was gifted is stalling.  At first I thought this was an issue with excessive fines because I have read that the Wilfa creates a lot of fines, but I discovered upon switching back to the plastic two-cup v 60 I have that my brews weren't stalling and were much more evenly extracted, so it seems to be a problem with the v 60 itself. Does anyone have any advice or has run into this problem with ceramic brewers? Not sure if this is a technique thing or what the problemo is.

I am using a buono kettle and have been brewing 30g of coffee to 450-480g of water depending on the coffee. The coffee I was brewing yesterday had a 3.30 brew time on the plastic v60 at the grind setting between aeropress and filter on the Wilfa but I had to go three clicks finer when using the ceramic to get it under 4 minutes and the taste was fairly whack. I'm using these filters ([https://cloudpickercoffee.ie/products/hario-v60-filters?variant=37142105686165](https://cloudpickercoffee.ie/products/hario-v60-filters?variant=37142105686165))

I have a family member who is a big coffee person (which is how I got into it) and they have a Jura E8 coffee maker. That's how I started on coffee, just went straight into a Sumatra dark roast with the coffee option (I love the flavor of the Sumatra, very earthy! Haven't tried anything else yet tho.) I just use the ""coffee"" option, I don't try to get too fancy. I'm not really a fan of the steamed milk that you can do on the machine for the espresso and macchiatos. I hope I'm not commuting a cardinal sin by questioning it, but what is the point of the steamed milk? Does it add texture or something like that? I've yet to find a clear answer to what it does to the coffee or if it does anything. It seems like a novelty in a way, by putting fluffy milk on strong coffee. 

I mostly don't like the steamed milk bc I don't get it's purpose. What does steamed milk do? Am I a heretic for just enjoying plain Jane coffee? Also, what advice would you give to a beginner coffee drinker? Thanks!",1614464805

Just thought I’d share this anecdote about my pursuit of a better cup, from one cheapskate to other potential under-cutters out there.

For Christmas last year (14 months ago) my folks teamed up to buy me a Technivorm Moccamaster. I don’t know what model exactly, but it has a glass carafe with 10-cup capacity and it’s all brushed stainless steel. Totally gorgeous. The kind of thing I would never have spent the money on for myself, and I thanked them up and down — I truly use it and enjoy it every single day, even more than a year after getting it.

Now, about my proclivity for being a cheapskate: I routinely treat myself with nice stuff, and I buy nice gifts for family when occasions come around. But I have trouble justifying certain things that actually ARE worth spending money on, and it gets kind of foolish — but more to the point, here, when I first received my Moccamaster I cheaped out on a coffee grinder and purchased a $60 Krups model thinking it would do justice to this $300+ brewer and $15 bags of beans. And of course it didn’t. Thanks to the brewer and bean quality I was getting, it was still the best coffee I’d ever made at home, but not on par with what I’d expect in a pricey café, or like in my old employer’s office where multiple coffee-heads conspired to supply us with pricey beans for the Baratza Encore and high-end Bunn brewing setup. 

One week ago, my Krups failed me for the last time. It would begin to grind beans from the hopper only to slow and jam up, making a loud buzzing sound. After multiple disassembles, cleanings and troubleshooting sessions failed to solve the issue, I contacted the warranty team at Krups to get my money back and poured that refund (plus a bag of Stumptown beans) into OXO’s $99 conical burr grinder. 

All I can say is holy cow, I feel like an idiot, and I wish I’d bought this grinder (or something of similar quality) right off the bat. I managed to dial in the grind size and volume pretty well on the first try, and my first brew this morning made former batches from the Moccamaster seem totally worthless in comparison. I finally feel like I’m reaching some of the potential the brewer itself is worth — it’s inspiring me to use my Kalita 185 and Chemex more often to get an even better sense of the grind capabilities, and make the most out of more consistent and controllable grinding. 

The good news is that my Moccamaster is really only “broken in” after 300+ brew cycles, primed to enjoy for years to come; I guess the process I’ve gone through here is almost akin to when you drink your first sixer of Budweiser, think that’s not half bad, and then months later someone introduces you to a craft saison that blows your mind. Here I was thinking I was making fine coffee, and now I shake my head at the swill produced by more primitive (pound-foolish) efforts from my year-long amateur hour. 

Don’t be like me, folks — invest a bit, buy for quality, and do justice to your expensive beans, your pretty brewer, your hand-crafted Chemex or sexy stainless Kalita. You (and your equipment) deserve the payoff.",1614456981

Is there alternatives to this product/brand? I’d say it’s worth the price 100% but I’m in a spot right now where it’s probably not smart to spend $20-$30 (according to amazon) on coffee beans. So looking for a reasonable alternative until I can splurge and treat myself to La Colombe once more!

The thing that I found really interesting is that the brew guides all emphasize heavy center pours, purposely trying to attain a valley in the coffee bed. I watched their video and compared it to Hoffman's V60 guide and its pretty much contradictory in every way. Has anyone used Onyx's method with success? I tried it a couple times and the results were okay, but I definitely felt like extraction was less even because of how drastic the deep valley in the coffee bed was, and at the end of the draw down I don't have the near perfectly flat coffee bed that I have with the Hoffman one.",1614441724

Percolated in a Corningware stovetop percolator with pre-ground Eight O'clock arabica coffee purchased at the grocery store, it was the best, never since duplicated coffee experience I have ever had.  The water used was VILE.  That well water was actually tinted grey with iron and had the most terrible rotten egg smell.  ""Drink this, it's really healthy for you!"" my brother would say.  I couldn't drink it and could hardly even stand to bathe in it.  So how did my grandmother make such divine coffee (and tea) with such vile water with no filtration? She was a simple farm woman (a top notch seamstress and cook) and certainly did not have access to a lot of the mod cons we enjoy today.  She broke every single rule of coffee making that were touted even in 1950s cook books (you should have seen the inside of the percolator - eek!) and yet still made memorable coffee.

Otherwise seems like a good fit for us, but I am going to have to get something else. I would love some suggestions for grinders that satisfy the following constraints. Listed in order of importance:

- Must be multi-gen friendly. My FIL, who is almost 80, lives with us and drinks drip. The machine needs to be simple enough that he can easily change the grind setting for his coffee and we can change it back to espresso. A large knob with ""steps"" or programmable buttons would be ideal.


- Must be quietish. We had a Capresso Infiniti before and it's noise level was fine. I'm not expecting ""quiet"", just something that won't drown out my wife's voice if she's on a conference call in an adjacent room with the door closed.


- Optimized for espresso, but produces decent drip. Nobody is going to be ruminating over the drip, but grind quality should be similar to a low-end burr grinder.


- Ideally fits under a kitchen cabinet, say &lt; 16""/40cm.


- Ideally under $500. Price is only an obstacle in that the purchase has to be justified to my wife, who thought $250 was crazy for a grinder. Something home repairable will be an easier sell if it's a more expensive model.

The blades, the threaded shaft, and all.  Now, I have not seen any cleaning or repair guides detail this happening. After sliding it back in, it is nowhere near the calibration it was. Actually, the burrs run into each other near the fine setting. I cannot find any guide or way to get that inner burr further in. It is threaded on both sides, but when it is “fully” inserted, it will not turn without turning the drive motor. Any suggestions or references?? Thanks!",1614908824

Coffee,SlyBox,lxucmr,Horibble/no customer service from Bodum,"Over the past year I started to really appreciate a good cup of coffee and have upgraded to what I think is a pretty good starter setup compared to the pre ground Kirkland stuff I was brewing before.

One of my first pieces I bought to knock my coffee game up a couple of notches was a grinder. Since this was my first piece I didn't want to break the bank so I went with the modestly priced Bodum Bistro Bur Grinder. All in all the grinder was pretty great considering I spent only about $70 on it. It worked good enough for me at the time and would get daily use.

Fast forward to 10 months later - I pop some beans in and hear the motor whirring but the burr isn't spinning. I figure since this fell within the one year period I'd be fine getting a warranty replacement.

I emailed Bodum with the warranty request and waited. 1 week went by, no reply. I then sent a second email, 3 days go by and still no reply.

I figure they're busy so I wait a full 2 weeks before trying to reach out to them again. This time I reach out on their instagram page. This time I get a message back asking for my email. Great! I'm finally getting somewhere. Nope. Nothing comes of this. So I message again...and again. Nothing. At this point I now go to their Facebook page and message them to which they respond asking which country I'm in, I tell them. And guess what..no reply. 

It's now been almost 3 weeks and I haven't even had my issue acknowledged. This is beyond frustrating.

Since I needed a grinder I hit the forums for suggestions and one that popped up as a good starter grinder was the Baratza Encore. I've heard great things about the quality of their product and how good their customer service is which I'm now realizing how important it is to value when buying a product.

Here's to hoping it's smooth sailing with the Baratza as I'm vowing never to purchase another Bodum product.",1614889649

Coffee,MSmithRD,lxrhrd,Are there coffee makers/pots that have the convenience of a Keurig?,"Hey folks,

I'm looking for a single cup coffee maker, that has a tall water reservoir for like 10 cups of coffee and that I can put in an entire lb of beans (preferably whole beans).  Then, I just put my cup under it, hit single cup button, and it'll use just enough beans and water for 1 cup.  Water is already hot so it comes out quick.  My work office had this, but it's clearly a commercial machine that probably costs hundreds if not thousands.  Anything like this in the residential market?  I've seen single cup coffee makers with water reservoir, but I believe you have to add the beans every time you want to make a cup (it's hard to tell though so I'm not sure).  Basically I want both a water and a bean reservoir, so that every time I make coffee, it's just a single click, similar to the convenience of a Keurig.

Coffee,tdrr12,lxq8dn,What equipment should I buy when I only want to pull two consistently decent double shots every day? (No steaming / frothing required!),"Hi /r/Coffee,

I've read through your (quite helpful) wiki, but would really appreciate some more specific equipment recommendations as my equipment demands probably differ quite a bit from the average consumer.

**Equipment demands**: Two double-shots of espresso, about 5 hours apart. No frothing, no other drinks -- I haven't used the steam wand on my current machine once in \~10 years (except when cleaning/descaling). While I am into really good espresso, I am also a big fan of convenience and hope I don't have to waste too much energy having a machine be on and/or pre-heating for a long time.

**Current setup**: Gaggia Classic that I tricked out over time (PID mod and aftermarket improvement parts)  + Gaggia MDF Grinder (w/ stepless mod). I have had this setup for \~10 years now and have probably replaced about half of the machine during that time (yay for easily available parts!), but feel like it's time for an upgrade. A good amount of research went into that purchase a decade ago, but my knowledge of the coffee equipment world hasn't been updated since and seems woefully outdated now.

**Budget (machine plus grinder):** Ideally $1,500, absolute max $3,000.

I'm not averse to buying used (I've acquired some great kitchen equipment via CL or restaurant auctions) and doing some rehab / repair myself. I would really appreciate any suggestions!",1614879297

For the past week I've been drinking the same coffee every morning, prepared the same way, but today I had a donut with it.  I started eating the donut first, then sipped my coffee and thought ""What is this??  Did I really mess up the Aeropress recipe that much??"".  The coffee tasted so smoky, not at all how it normally tastes.  I finished my donut and kept drinking, and the coffee slowly started to change back to how it normally tastes; no more extreme smoky flavor.  These beans definitely have a slight smokiness to them, but it's never overpowering.  I guess the sweetness of the donut allowed the smokiness of the coffee to come through even more so than normal.  Good thing I didn't dump my cup out halfway through the donut!",1614867641

- 10s extraction 🤦‍♀️
- grind size 9
- 16g of espresso
- perfect pressure (12oclock on the pressure gauge)

Now 11g is already too much, but it is definitely not looking like much in the single shot basket. If I go finer it will mean that I wont even have enough coffee to tamp it unless I use more than 11g... which brings me to my question - is there a smaller basket for the same portafilter?

I've been using a spinny-blade grinder for, oh, 20 years or so. Ordered a Timemore C2 on Amazon. I waited with massive anticipation at how this one thing might change my pour-over experience (the V2 is on the way).

I have always put 4 scoops (\~30g) of beans into my grinder. The Timemore holds all of 3, and barely at that. I didn't bother weighing them. I emptied it and went back to the spinny-blade, anticipating returning the C2.

Any advice before I box this $85 waste of money up and ship it back? Do I just need to do multiple fill/grind/empty cycles for one cup of coffee?

I am or better was not a coffee drinker. For my birthday 2 years back I got a small coffee machine (Nescafé Dolce Gusto). I don't like machines that use caps because they cause a lot of trash but I was okay with it because it was meant only when we get guests and I was happy to finally be able to offer coffee to my friends.

I really started to like one of the flavours though and I start drinking a mug daily pretty much. I just really hate that I cause so much plastic trash with it and would like to switch to a better machine that maybe can make a coffee straight from the beans. I still want to get something that is not too strong in coffee taste if you know what I mean (I'm new to coffee and I know this sentence might get my lynched here...).  
My favourite caps from Nescafé were the Café Au Lait and I would love to find a way to reproduce this with a normal machine. I thought maybe someone here can me help with two things:

1. Helping me a cheap/ middle class machine that could do that. It probably will need a milk tank? not sure
2. Tips on how to make a milky and sweet coffee in a machine like this. What beans? Any tips for making it?

Coffee,marshallfrost,lseali,Onyx Website/CS: the key to happiness is low expectations,"Hi everybody! Long time lurker here who attributes a lot of his coffee gains to this community's great discussion and theorycrafting.

Unfortunately my first post is curated to address an issue that sounds like some of you are relating to when I tried to find similar experiences in the sub. However, I think it's important to keep increasing awareness when CS goes wrong in hopes that they'll eventually decide to put the customer first in these areas instead of QUESTION THE CUSTOMER'S INTENTIONS.

As I think most of us know, but for anyone considering Onyx, whether one time purchase of subscription, Onyx produces a great product most of the time. With the right setup at home, the end product can be insanely fruity(speaking from trying their Africans), complex, and light but also achieving a balance on the palate. 

But their CS is absolute trash and their website/subscription service UI leaves a lot to be desired. Especially on mobile. And I think that's partially the issue.

Let me explain. And I know some of you will think this is basically user error for the most part, and I would think there's a lot of merit in that argument, but I also think Onyx's mobile website experience is DREADFUL and CONFUSING. And I build websites for a living. 

I created a subscription for their Geometry blend, 2 lbs in a monthly cycle. Apparently what happens when you create a subscription is an order is processed on the spot for that sub. This is going on memory at this point, but I don't remember any declaration that this was the case. 

So I create the subscription. I go into my account subscription and notice it says March 19th. I'm thinking, ""Hmm, well I really want the subscription to fulfill immediately, and then start monthly so let me change it to the upcoming Friday so I get my coffee early next week"" and it's Thursday at this point. The system will not warn you or say that an order based on the same subscription is already processing, are you sure you want to do this? So while I made a bone headed mistake of assuming my subscription wasn't processed as an order immediately, their website certainly isn't sophisticated enough to realize a user could be making a potential mistake by duplicating an order in a time frame of 24 hours. Learn from my dumb mistake.

Okay, now at this point I obviously have two orders for 2 lb geometry by like midnight Friday. Nothing from an email standpoint looked weird since they were duplicate order confirmations, but obviously I was oblivious to the order dates and times and didn't have any reason to believe there was a problem. Again, there's plenty of merit in just saying I'm dumb.

They fulfill both orders on that same Friday and ship them out the same day. I remember thinking it's weird that I have two different tracking numbers listed, but it hsd already shipped right? I just let it play out and I received them mid week this week. To be sure, I was surprised to receive two 2 lb bags of geometry.

Got on the horn with CS through their website (again, bad experience) to try to come to any resolution, as being 84 dollars out (instead of 42) and 4 lbs of coffee is not my idea of a good time. 

Totally unsympathetic to my plight and actually felt like I was being accused of something and why didn't I reach out sooner to resolve the issue before shipment blah, blah, blah. The duplicate order was literally processed, fulfilled, and shipped same day and obviously I wanted one of the orders. I didn't expect a refund and they didn't want to give me one anyway, but I thought it would be a gesture of good faith, due to the ambiguous process, technical limitations of the website and wanting to keep an existing customer happy, that they could ease the pain with a discount toward a future purchase. Keep in mind we're wasting plenty of time because the rep is trying to pin the situation on me to avoid actually providing good customer service. So I cut to the chase AND OFFER THE SOLUTION THE REP SHOULD BE FACILITATING. 

In the end, the rep offers a code for 10% off a future purchase. Wow, I get those in regular email feeds from Onyx. Really above and beyond and absolutely worth my time to address this issue. /s

So probably needless to say, I will definitely be laser focused if I ever order through Onyx again, subscription or no. Website leaves a lot to be desired and the CS they provide had no intention to offer a meaningful solution to any issues that may result from that cold, dead void.

The end.",1614280317

I'm going through a sampler from Beanbox right now (thanks mom!) which has been really fun and exposed me to a lot of different origins, roasters, etc.  The problem is that each sample basically makes me two cups of coffee so I have one day to set a baseline and then one day to optimize.  I've started to figure out what to change in order to optimize taste (temp, ratio, time, etc) thanks to folks on here.

I've found that for some of the samples, I've made some delicious cups, whereas for others even when I think I know what I need to tweak, things just don't come out as nice as I want.  Does anyone have thoughts on how to differentiate between a roast that I just don't like/is low-quality and just not using the right mix of time/temp/ratio/grind/etc?

I'm striving for the delicious, complex wonderful flavor every time, and whereas I've gotten really close some times, I just strike out others.  Would love to hear thoughts on this.

Q. Damage on Filter Basket
A. If too much pressure is applied over again (more than 15-16 bars which makes espresso shot over extracted), the Filter Basket can be damaged. There are a few factors to build up too much high pressure that you need not only to avoid over extraction but also to prevent product damage as listed below. 

[Factors to make too high pressure (recommendation on spec)]
(1) Too much coffee grounds (10 to 15 gram)
(2) Too fine espresso grounds (no Turkish grounds: too fine)
(3) Too hard tamping (soft tamping up to 15g grounds, hard tamping down to 10g)

These factors can affect each other so that you need to find optimised result.

---

They seem to believe that 15-16 bars is when their filter screen starts to fail, which is complete nonsense. When I broke mine, for instance, I wasn't anywhere near 15-16 bars and the espresso wasn't overextracted at all. If anything, it tasted *good* and the look of it was pretty excellent.

The physics speak for themselves. To get 15-16 bars of pressure you would need to be putting 91.8kg of pressure on the 6.12cm^2 piston, which is impossible for most people. My entire weight is only 65kg.

So this tells me a few things: 

- Cafflano probably won't be making their basket better if they believe their current basket only breaks at 15 bars.

- Cafflano officially sees any basket damage as user error and won't warranty it.

- The Kompresso will never be able to make ""real"" espresso at 9 bars. Yes, good espresso can often be made at much lower pressures, especially for lighter roasts which turn out super sour at high pressures, but you will never be able to duplicate the results of a real espresso machine like the Flair that can safely do 9 bars all day long. The Kompresso will never be a true Flair competitor because the basket will just break apart if attempted.

- If you want 9 bar espresso, you need to hack together your own basket (the basket width is 47mm and 20mm deep) and the 45mm Zacconi basket fits it:
 https://www.kaffee-netz.de/threads/cafflano-kompresso-tuning.128707/

So in the end, the Kompresso will indeed just be able to make espresso-like drinks. It's kind of sad, really. The Kompresso concept is sound and the 9-bar espresso ""standard"" is completely attainable using this design, but for whatever reason it looks like Cafflano thinks it has already gotten there with the perfect product and likely won't make a better basket. The Kompresso has already been out for several years.

This is their response for getting replacements:

---

For the replacement parts, yes you can buy any parts directly from us. Just make sure which parts you want to buy.

For example, the cost of the filter basket is US$10.00/each, the cost of the shower screen filter(metal part) is US$4.50/each,

The shower screen gasket(red silicon o-ring) is US$4.00 and the shipment is US$15.00 / one shipment to Thailand.

(Laos is not available for the delivery as of now due to COVID-19 and Thailand is cheaper and quicker than China.)

This shipment is made from Korea &amp; by EMS-Economy(K-Packet) and takes about 4 ~ 8 weeks due to COVID-19.

(normaly delivery time was 2 ~ 4 weeks and the delivery cost was US$9.00 via EMS-Economy(K-Packt) before COVID.

yes, we fully agree with that it is not a good time to buy the replacement parts.)",1614267041

My press is 350 ml and I saw online that 13-14 grams of coffee is good, but that amount is a little less than half of the press. Is this normal? It seems like A LOT of coffee to me, I went back online to double check and there are people recommending 1:12 and even 1:16 which would make no sense in my case as it would most likely fill my entire press with just ground coffee.

So it's either that my math is wrong or that I've done some really stupid shit like measuring the coffee beans instead of ground coffee (...because that doesn't matter right?).

Coffee,Dheorl,lrwjfr,Questions Regarding Building an Espresso Machine,"I hope this is an ok place to ask this. The sidebar says all things coffee, and I couldn't think of a better sub, so fingers crossed.

So basically, for reasons I'm not entirely sure about myself, I've decided I fancy a go at building an espresso machine. I'm going to go for a basic spring lever machine; something like a Elektra Micro Casa, and just want to get a few things sorted.

So fundamentals: I need a place for hot water, a way of moving said hot water to under the piston, a spring to supply pressure to the piston and lever to initially compress said spring, a screen to stop the water stirring up the coffee puck and a way of holding said puck?

I'm fine with most of that, but there's a few specific questions I have. First off, when it comes to the piston, they have two gaskets, and at rest the water inlet is between these two gaskets. I'm assuming this isn't a problem, because all machines seem to do it, but it doesn't seem unreasoanble that water could sit between those two gaskets for extended periods and then mix with brewing water. So is it fine if that happens?

Secondly, does it matter where in the group the water inlet is? I assume it can be right at the bottom, but many machine seem to place it higher up. Is there a reason for this, or just that there's no reason not to and it's a design choice?

Lastly, portafilter connection. Obviously most machines go for a simple twist on, but is there any good reason to not go for a simple screw thread?

Thanks for any advice you can give, and yes, I accept I'm possibly a bit crazy for wanting to do this.",1614222492

I'm becoming quite overwhelmed.,"I've read through the post/link that offers great recommendations for espresso makers, based, for what I can tell is mostly on price, which is fine, but I'm afraid I have gotten completely undone by my days of research.

So my situation is this. I've been searching for that perfect espresso machine. I thought it was mostly about price, but I've come to realize it's so much more that that. I'm looking for a relatively easy to use, but still brews a mean cup. I want something that saves me from the daily coffee house trips. I'm looking for a quality espresso, with a good crema. I like my mixed drinks as well, but I honestly don't see myself becoming any sort of an aficionado, so I don't think I want something that needs special attention and dialing in. I've compared the Breville Barista, the Rancillo Silvia Espresso, the Gaggia Classic Pro (and many others) and I just ended up feeling slightly intimidated. I'm wondering if I'd be better with a De'Longhi Stitlosa or even a Brim 19 Bar? Or even one of the hand pulled ones recommend on the link this group has? They seem pretty cool. 

I have a tendency to overthink this kind of stuff and just put myself off from it, and I don't want to do this now. I really enjoy coffee, I'd like to enjoy it even more, but I also want to be realistic and know I'm still pretty much a newb.

Coffee,travanator,lrlswc,Sharing my Breville Precision Brewer method that I'm finally happy with,"After doing pour overs every morning for 8 years, I decided that waking up to good coffee can be a magical experience that makes a typical workday morning better. So I pulled the trigger on the Breville Precision Brewer (glass carafe).

I program the brewer the night before probably 4 days a week. Yes, some flavor is lost by grinding the beans 8 hours ahead of brewing, but it's pretty minimal in my opinion.

**Here we go:**

* 60 grams of coffee to 886 grams of water (66.7 grams per liter)
* Baratza Encore click 18 (medium grind)
* Bloom: 40 seconds
* Temperature: 201F
* Flow rate: Medium
* *Here's the secret sauce*... **two** pre-wet #4 Melitta paper filters for the cone attachment
   * If I'm programming for overnight brewing, I actually do wet the filters with cold water and don't believe this to negatively impact the flavor, almost no extraction should occur
   * If I use just one filter, the flow rate is too fast for my grind, and going finer with the grind size for me always made it worse
   * Two filters slows down the drain rate but not too much

**Some other tips:**

* The shower head has a fairly strong pour right down the middle and it makes an indent that impacts even extraction, so instead of a typical divot in the middle that you'd do for a pour over, I actually try to make a mound in the middle to compensate for this
* I usually have the hot plate off because it gets VERY hot and can burn the coffee - I just pour any that I want to keep warm in a thermos. However, sometimes I'll have the hot plate on for just a few minutes then switch it off

* Frizzlife TAM3 ($29, replace every 12 months): Target TDS 10-30 ppm, which minerals??? Carbon filter.
* Everpure 7CC-BW ($85, replace every 6 months): Uses calcium carbonate
* Mineral Pro 700 ($69, replace every 12 months): Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium. Carbon filter.
* Optipure MA-Q15 ($90, replace every 6 months): Adds calcium / magnesium

Coffee,teitelez,lmzldi,Bialetti Moka Pot Questions,"Hi coffee drinkers,

I have a 3 cup aluminum Moka Express and 6 cup stainless steel Musa. Both make great coffee and have been in service for 10 and 5 years respectively. I have a question that perhaps coffee people smarter than me know the answer to...

**When I brew in the smaller aluminum maker, the coffee flows out of the spout very slowly, steadily, with lots of bubbles (foam) - almost espresso-like. With the larger steel Musa, the coffee flows pretty steadily, but sputters a little more, and has hardly any bubbles (which dissipate quickly). Why the difference? I'm guessing something to do with water volume to pressure ratio? Or perhaps the heat conductivity of aluminum and steel?**  

My recipe for each is the same and pretty standard: boiling water in the reservoir, slightly coarser than espresso grind, no tamping, just level off the full basket, medium heat on the gas range, coffee is ready in similar times in both pots - about 30-60 seconds... now that think of it, I don't know why this brewing time isn't different given the different sizes...

And just to be clear, the coffee is great from both - I don't actually want to change my brewing method - I am just curious as to the difference of foam in the pot makers (and I now why the brewing time is more or less the same)

I love the Aeropress, but I've been recently drawn back to the idea of a pour over.  The last one I had was a big 8-cup Chemex which I enjoyed, but rarely got to use.  I'd also like to downsize a bit in my apartment, so I was curious as to people's opinions on the Chemex 3 cup for double-duty on being able to make enough for one or two cups.

Coffee,kruzman20,lmworn,Gaggia Brera - calibration,"My next door neighbor gave me his.  I was not looking for one.  I am not as into coffee as some people, but I do respect you guys that are and learned from you enough to buy myself an aeropress and was happy with it.  I also had a little experience with making espressos when the tech company I worked for bought a $9K machine and I was making a couple a day while at work, and learned how good coffee could taste.  I never achieved that with the aeropress but that was to be expected.

So the next door neighbor offered me his Gaggia Brera and I figured why not.  I have been struggling to get a decent espresso from it.  I've tried different strengths from the one bean, two bean, three bean settings on the front and tried different grinds from the grind setting knob on top.  Also tried light, medium and dark roast beans. 

Also I've cleaned the main mechanism and also opened it and cleaned the grind wheel.  But it never makes a flavorful coffee or espresso.  It creates a crema foam but the espressos are not thick and flavorful.

My latest theory is that it is not grinding the coffee well.  After it makes a shot it expels a puck into a container and I have examined the output of fine grain, medium and coarse and I hardly see any difference.  (picture attached)   I would think that I should a big difference.  I don't have a burr grinder at home but when I put a bag of coffee through the grinder at a supermarket I can see a large difference in the output of the dry coffee depending on the grind settings.   When I examine the used pucks from the Brera after they have dried out I don't see much size difference.   It makes me think that the Brera may not be grinding correctly.  

I did a chat session with a Gaggia store and learned that I need to calibrate it by running a bunch of shots but that doesn't seem like a process that will fix the fact that the grinds are not much different between the fine and coarse settings.  

Does anybody have any experience with this machine and can guide me through this?  The chat session with the store was pointing me toward probably needing to send it in.  (they did send me instructions for running a calibration but they don't seem to make sense.)   I don't want to send in the machine because of the expense.  I could probably buy a burr grinder and maybe manual espresso machine for the cost I suspect it would be to get the Brera repaired/calibrated.",1613680970

Coffee,gooneyleader,lmsv44,Everyone always asks about how I make my Large Batch Cold Brew....Well Here ya go.,"This is a great way to make  large batch cold brew at home with little investment and just a bit of time. This method can make anywhere from 2 gallons to 10 plus gallons. Great for the spring and Summer months, also great to giveaway to friends and family as a gift.  

1) Buy some Nut milk bags off of amazon. Its basically a giant reusable filter bag that all the coffee will sit in while its brewing. 

2) Buy your coffee. Fresher the better. Do not buy pre-ground coffee. Grind for Coarse. I use about a half pound of coffee per gallon of water. I usually cant afford it but I try and get the big 5lb bag of Hair Bender from Stumptown. Not the cheapest, but its hands down the best. 

3) Using a large pot, put your ground coffee in the nut milk bag and add appropriate amount of water. You can even make ""concentrate"" style cold brew or ""half-caf"", make to your liking. 

4) Let steep for 24-48 hours. Agitate the bag by moving it up and down in  the pot. Do this several times through out the brew cycle before dumping the ground coffee. Once the you pull the bag out let the container sit for 12 hours, do not agitate the container. 

5) After 12 hours you can carefully pour the  brew into mason jars or gallon jugs. If your a perfectionist you can buy some food grade brew line hose and syphon the clean brew until you hit the sludge.  Expect some loss at the bottom of the pot and toss sludge in the yard. Your done!",1613671337

Coffee,alorne85,lmp7qe,Moccamaster KB741 vs. other SCA Home Brewers - Purchase advice needed,"Hey all,

I thought I had found the right automatic home brewer (Moccamaster KB741) but after reading countless posts about Moccamasters, I'm not sure if it's the *one* anymore.

For context, I've been making coffee daily with a V60 for five or more years and I'm just a little bored of the process. I like the coffee I get from it but I'd also love something I can switch on and walk away from. The other reason for wanting an automatic machine is because when guests are over in the future I'd like to be able to make a batch of coffee instead of slowly making pour-overs one-by-one.

What stood out to me about the MM is that it's simple, it's SCA certified, it has a good warranty, it's easy to get replacement parts, and it feels like a buy-it-once purchase; plus it looks cool. What I keep seeing in other posts is that in order to get a good cup, you need to intervene so that you get even saturation of the grounds. If I don't do that, and assuming that I'm using good beans that are well ground, will it still produce good coffee? It seems weird that the MM would get the SCA certification if you have to do these manual hacks to achieve good results. Or does the SCA certification not actually mean that much?

Currently I only brew 400ml of coffee with the V60. If I do a similar size batch with the MM, will I have less of an issue with the even saturation since there will be less coffee in the basket? I decided on the KB741 because it has the different flow options and would work better for smaller batches.

Is anyone else in a similar position? Are you happy with just turning on the MM and letting it brew? If you're not happy with the MM, what brewer did you get or wish you got instead?

I'm not trying to win any awards with this coffee. I just want it to taste good without obsessing over it.

I’ve been using my encore for drip, French press, and clever dripper for a while now, never really needing to go below like setting 10.  

I just bought a moka pot to try out some faux-spresso, should be here tomorrow. All the moka pot videos I’ve watched on YouTube recommend grinding as fine as you can on grinders like the Encore (ie entry level grinders that can’t really do espresso). Just to experiment I dialed all the way down to 0 and tried to grind some beans, but nothing came out at all. I didn’t get anything until I got up to like 5 or 6.  

Is this normal?  Do you have to like grind on 40 first and then on 0 so the coarse grounds can actually fit into the burrs?

I didn’t hear any horrible grinding sounds so I don’t think the burrs are touching each other or anything like that.

Coffee,coldpav,lmbe48,V60 v Me: Round 1,"It was 2:30 in the afternoon and I was determined to claim victory over the V60 which had been sitting in my cupboard for the past week, mocking me as it gathered dust. Finally I would push open the gates to Coffee Land, a magical place of Reddit coffee snobs preaching about Ethiopians and third wave baristas that could stare me down until I confessed to my previous Starbucks sins - I would belong at last.

I set to work - gathered my scale (with my phone as my simultaneous timer), my kettle (not gooseneck), and some decent medium roast (freshly ground on medium-fine). Having watched the Holy Grail (Hoffman's Technique), with one of the top comments instructing me word for word, I was prepared. I hoped the coffee grounds couldn't smell my fear.

Reader, my first mistake was when I poured in the coffee grounds into the filter... and I had maybe 3 mm of space left to the top of the filter. *It's fine,* I thought, *all the water will still fit*. *I can still swirl as beautifully as James.*

It was not fine. 

I actually managed to pour in 2x the coffee weight in the first 30s, but after this all hope was lost. My flow rate was not limited by 8 g/s, but rather the painstaking slowness at which the bed drained. I observed dejectedly as water overflowed the filter and ran down the sides of the V60 and despaired as I reached 60% of the total brew weight in t = 2:30. **This phase is critical!** the comment berated me. How I wished I could apologise.

As I finished my brew by t = 4:45, I realised I had lost my first battle with Mr. Hario. My punishment? The murky, blacker than black coffee that seemed to suck all the surrounding light in.  Bitter, bitter, bitter - the angelic nutty cocoa and ethereal stone fruit notes must have flown off in disgrace.

Weariness becomes me. The fight for Coffee Land will continue tomorrow, after I have recuperated my resources (e.g., the will to live).

The first time I brew from a new bag of coffee it always seems to come out great. Full bodied, balanced flavors, perfect extraction. As soon as the next day up to a week or two that I’m brewing that coffee the quality declines, sometimes significantly, to almost undrinkable. This is without any change in brewing parameters. It’s hard to tell if I’m under or over extracting on subsequent brews but the quality definitely declines. 

I’ve heard that grinding coarser and up-dosing should help but I’ve had mixed results. Anyone have similar issues and how do you deal with it?

Current brew setup is: 
Brewer: Breville precision brewer using pour over attachment with a V60. 30 second bloom time. 205 degree water. 1:16 ratio (30 g coffee to 480 g water)

Grinder: Breville smart grinder pro, typically medium/drip grind size around setting 45-48 

Coffee: typically light/medium roast single origins from local roasters 

Coffee storage: vacuum sealed container, protected from light.

Since I realized I can grind a lot finer, I started actually getting really good cups out of the Clever, and decided I'd rather not fuss over the V60 and just get an easy, consistently good cup of coffee with the Clever.

But, the more I use the Clever, the more I still encounter inconsistency. I've been following Hoffmann's technique of grinding somewhat finer, water at boiling, pouring water first then grounds, stir the top till there's no more chunks of dry coffee at the top, let it sit for 2+ minutes, stir (and/or sometimes shake) and let sit for 30 seconds, then drain. Sometimes I get pretty tasty cups. The first cup out of this new bag of Ethiopian from Coava was incredible. The second cup was slightly less. Every cup since then has been mediocre to plain bad. My grind size has been more or less the same, with only small experimentations one or two clicks on either end, using my Encore with M2 burr set.

Isn't the Clever supposed to be super consistent? What the heck is going on? Why is it that the first cup from this bag was one of the best cups of this particular coffee from Coava I've ever had, but I can't get the same flavor in any other cup since?

Keep in mind this is for an area that is not filled with coffee lovers (and that’s the aim, to bring a quality coffee to the area). 

There is someone who has been giving advice to us saying that he can get us a cheaper machine, with a cheaper bean for better margins because people won’t know the difference and now I’m having to convince the partners in the business that is not the way to go.

I happened to snatch a good deal on a BBE earlier today and even though I haven't received the item yet, I was wondering if there is anything I can do to prepare myself for its eventual arrival. The seller mentioned they bought it second hand and it's in really good condition, with the box, accessories, and everything (I have pictures). When it's plugged in the lights turn on like normal but, they never flash to indicate that it's ready, thus having a warmed-up machine that apparently cant grind, steam or pull.

I'm planning to take it to a local repair shop but if you guys have any idea of what it could be it would be extremely helpful!

Coffee,Cobboolio,loj4jf,What makes bad coffee beans so bad?,"Have just recently got a grinder and some beans. Ran out  of beans and a local deli shop sells cheap coffee beans (£2 for 250g), so thought I would try it. The beans just  smelled odd, and the brewed coffee actually made me feel a bit nauseous and tasted awful, like ashy and really dark.

What the hell was that coffee, and why was it so bad? It was labeled as ""Migro Coffee"" in a plastic bag. My first guess would be they were really burnt? Is there anything else that could make beans taste awful?",1613862321
Coffee,dgmischief,loiwfx,Coffee for 6-12 people? Can anyone suggest a 2 Liter or larger french press?,"Super grateful for this sub. I went from kind of knowing how to do pourovers to ""the coffee guy"". I've invested in an espresso machine(Astra Pro) and a Niche. Unfortunately, it's still not a great time to host so my workaround has been to buy a 2L carafe and bring it to work gatherings and that sort of thing.

I'm wondering if people have suggestions for the best way to brew? I have an 8 cup Chemex which worked okay, but really only does around a liter and it's a pretty significant hassle especially if I haven't had coffee yet 😂. I've tried just dumping grounds into a 2L mason jar and pouring water over it. I then filter it through a coffee sock which makes some really good stuff but again I have to brew in two batches.

My thought is to buy a 2.5L french press which would have just enough capacity to make a 2L final batch. But honestly, I can't really seem to find one. I don't mind dropping a significant amount of money, I just want to make sure I'm buying something that will check all the boxes.",1613861699
Coffee,Super_Nintend0,lohgqe,Dialing in my Breville Barista Pro - Having some Trouble,"So I finally caught the bug, the daily desire to fill my house with that nutty, earthy aroma of fresh coffee and build my own barista skill set. This was an easy choice once I calculated how much I was spending at Starbucks, without even being particularly a fan of their coffee (they have such accessible parking). 

So I got Breville Barista Pro and am having a hell of a time pulling a decent double shot. 

I’ll start with where I wound up:

Best tasting shot: grind size - 5, dose - 15g, pour time, 18s. But no crema or body. 

Best looking shot: grind size - 4 (after stepping down the conical grinder internally), dose - 17g, pour time 25s. Nice honey/caramel color and good crema/body. Was too bitter. 

So now I’ve gone through a pound of coffee ( Kimbo Extra Cream )and a page and a half of experiment notes and still can’t quite get there. I basically ground it finer and finer playing with dose until I over extracted (33s) and then backed it out. 

Can someone please help me get over the hump and into flavor country?",1613857372
Coffee,Acavia8,logi3k,Acidity of coffee - enhance by not-brew water but water you normally drink.,"My brews are normally similar depending on parameters - grind size, water temperature, ratios etc.  Recently I lost power for several days. During that time, I drank stored well water, that was collected before my water softener, so it was hard water.  Since regaining power, I brewed coffee again, with Third Wave Water that I normally use - note: I never made coffee with my well water.

The coffee was extremely acidic tasting - it tasted like a strong acid drink, almost to extent like I was drinking a glass of white vinegar or something.  Each day, it got lighter tasting, even though same brew, and today's, the third, was still acidic tasting but closer to how I remember it.  The only thing I can think to explain it is that for several days I was drinking hard ground water, and my tastes became more accustomed to high mineral water, highlighting the contrast in the acidic taste in coffee.

Coffee,DJRoombaLives,lofuzm,10 year old Capresso Infinity grinder: replace burrs or replace whole thing?,"I’ve been using a Capresso Infinity grinder for 10-11 years. It’s the only burr grinder I’ve ever owned, and it’s been a very reliable machine. I’ve only done a deep clean on it a couple of times to get rid of oil build up. My only complaint about it is how removing the cup from the grinder always ends up flinging some grounds onto the counter.

My question is this: should I consider replacing the burrs at this point? Or have grinders improved enough in the last decade that I’d be happier getting something new? I remember the Infinity being a well-reviewed model back in 2010, but I don’t see it brought up in this subreddit at all. It looks like the same model is still available to purchase, so I figure that means it’s still at least somewhat popular.

The only real great cold brew I've been able to make with decaf beans is using the Starbucks Verona Decaf that semi-regularly goes on a sale for a decent price at my Publix.

1) when grinding, beans spit up out of the grinder part into the hopper, and it seems like there’s always one or two that don’t make their way into the burr and rattle around until i stop the grind, let them sink, then give it a short burst. Is this normal? 

2) the hopper itself seems to slightly vibrate and move a bit while the machine is on. Is that normal? 


Now more specific questions about brewing with. Pour over. I have a Boudum pour over, which i guess is kind of like a knockoff Chemex. I’ve tried grinding at a 20, 15, and 12 now, but I just can’t get the taste right. I’ve been doing 25G of coffee to 350g of water for a 1:14 ratio. It always tastes a too watered down. I’ll also mention that I’m using the mesh reusable filter that came with the pour over about 3 years ago. It’s not damaged or anything but I’m just throwing in all the variables for your information. 

I used 12 on the Encore for aero press and it was absolutely delicious. Definitely got hints and flavors from the coffee I’ve never tasted before, so I see the Baratza light, I’m just trying to get the proper settings dialed in for the pour over. The batches I’ve made in the boudum are nowhere near as delicious as from the aero press.

So what I have been doing over the last 5 years or so is I have a Capresso Grinder with 12 different fineness settings I use to do a ""mid-medium"" fineness grinding of the whole beans (If level 1 is ultra fine and level 12 is super coarse I have it set to level 8) I'm super I'm doing this part wrong but had no idea after trial and error over the years. The grindings look similar in size to those I see when I cut open a store bought sealed keurig pod.

I pour whole beans (lately been buying bones coffee) into the grinder from a sealed bag I store in a cabinet. I then fill a custom K-cup adapter pod up to around the 3/4th full mark with the grindings, set the keurig to a 14oz size, and brew the coffee directly into my mug or thermos. When I use a thermos it's typically too hot to drink on the way to work so I have to use a small ice cube to cool it down some. 

When I'm at home drinking from the mug it's the perfect temperature. I find the flavor to be pretty acceptable BUT I feel like I could be making myself a better cup of coffee.

I also have a spider graph and a bar chart that has some very limited industry info that I don't understand at all without context. Any hints as to what it means so I can research it more on my own would be greatly appreciated as I've hit a dead end on my own.

Coffee,didsomeonesaydonuts,lni5wu,Looking for suggestions on moving up from my Breville XL870.,"I’ve been using my 870 for about 3 years now. Over all very pleased with it as well as with the built in grinder. It’s pretty dialed in and only needs the occasional tweak. As for use I’m the only one that uses it and I typically pull between 2-4 shots a day. The main reasons I’m looking to move up is because of how loud the pump recharge is and how slow the steam wand is to start up. What I do like about this machine is it’s size (it just about fits under my cabinets) as well as how fast it is to start up from off and that it can be used, a bit awkwardly, one handed (when I’m holding our baby). 

I’m usually pulling my first shot around 5am when everyone is still sleeping and at times it wakes up my youngest and middle child. It is one floor down but the noise travels. Not sure if this level of noise is common on all machines or just especially loud on this one. I did have it checked and serviced by breville last year and it came back as operating as it should. 

As for budget for a new machine and grinder I’d like to stay below $1500 in total.

So our trusty Hamilton Beach 12-cup Brewstation that has been limping along for the six months we've been offhandedly saying to one another, ""You know, it's leaking more and more, we really should look at replacing it"" finally decided to retire to that big coffee shop in the sky this morning. According to my partner, a spring went flying just after he poured his work mug and coffee drenched the countertop and my dreams of having a second cup this morning. 


He wants to try fixing it first, bless his pack-bonded little soul, but barring that I'd like to have a replacement unit picked out and on standby to soothe the bitter taste of failure (and our caffeine withdrawal migraines). 


I think we'd like to avoid getting this model again. It's barely three years old and has been leaking for during every use for a sixth of its lifetime, but we need something that holds a significant amount of coffee. We certainly don't mind a carafe though our current maker is without one. 


I turn to you, most cultured of coffee connoisseurs, benevolent brew masters, purveyors of pep, and understanding audience of all good things in this world. What are your suggestions at prices of up to, let's say, around $200 USD?

Coffee,kageryu42,lnf9t4,Giannina Moka Pot and 1Zpresso JX-Pro Hand Grinder Quesitons,"Hi,
Recently, I've been thinking about stepping up my coffee game.  Right now I either drink black coffee brewed in a traditional coffee pot or coffee with just a little creamer.  I have a sweet tooth and sometimes can't help myself when it comes to the flavored creamers.  I hope this isn't a coffee taboo.

Anyway, instead of buying an expensive expresso machine, I thought about trying out a moka pot and good grinder.  I think I really like the Giannina 6 cup moka pot and the 1Zpresso JX-Pro.  However, I would like to read any of your comments about this setup before I pull the trigger.  I know I could get a far cheaper moka pot, but I really like the look, the finish and the features of the Giannina moka pots.  Especially the fact that the 6 cup model is really a 6 or 3 cup model.

I would also be interested in knowing what setting on the 1Zpresso JX-Pro would be good for the moka pot and how many grams or ounces I should grind for the 6 cup moka pot.  I'm guessing whatever number I get, I can half when I use the reducer for 3 cups.

Right now I’m looking for some guidance and opinions on choosing my next coffee setup. 

Currently I’m drinking mostly drip coffee from Gabi Master A and from V60. 
My setup contains Gaggia Classic, Wilfa Svart grinder, Hario electric kettle, V60, Aeropress, Prismo, Gabi Master A and few others. 

I would like to up my pour over game and choose right setup for me. 

I’m planning on getting 3 new grinders(drip, espresso and work/travel), drip coffee machine, and some kind of espresso setup. 



Grinder options:
- Wilfa Uniform - good, inexpensive and for single dosing 
- Baratza Forte - very good for drip, not ideal for single dosing 
- Niche Zero - good for espresso and single dosing 
- Gina Arco - this one I could use for home and travel. Easy single dosing and grind size adjustment. I’ve already bought one for my brother 
- Eureka Atom 75 - great espresso grinder but not ideal for singles dosing 
- Comandante with electric kit - electric kit is &gt;3x expensive than the grinder... but from what I’ve heard it should produce great results. It’s harder to adjust grind size 
- 1Zpresso JX PRO - inexpensive and good for travel 


Coffee machines
- Moccamaster
- Ratio Six
- Sage Precision Brewer - I don’t like the look of it 

Espresso 
- Cafelat Robot - easy workflow, no need for preheating, easy cleaning

At this point there's still almost a half of water in the lower chamber, but it doesn't want to flow, the pot just keeps spitting it out violently. The thing is, if I remove the pot from the stove, let it cool down, and then bring it back on the stove, the rest of the water starts flowing evenly again.

Coffee,LutheBeard,lqhroc,"Repair of broken paddlewheel on Krups EA9000 or: How to repair 1200,- bucks coffee machine with cable ties","I wanted to share my experience with you from repairing a Krups EA9000. So my father bought this machine a few years back and enjoyed it ever since, but since a few months he had a problem with the grinder. He tried to open it up and fix it, but never managed to get to the root of the problem. So the last time I visited him I have seen this machine outside, he told me he wanted to throw it out so I decided to give it a try.

I have to confess, I never was a big coffee drinker (I know, wrong sub and so on, but still this experience could be helpful to some of you). Still, since I like to tinker with machines, I decided to take the machine and take it apart to maybe find the root of the problem. After many hours of trying to disassemble the machine, I finally reached the grinder and decided to also dismantle this one. And here I realized the problem, a good summary of a similar problem you can also find in [this](https://www.epiphanydigest.com/2016/10/03/baratza-rescues-starbucks-grinder/) post. Since I did not have a 3D printer by hand and wanted to fix it right away, I decided to go with a little macgyver solution (as seen in the picture). And after putting it back in (multiple times in the wrong direction) it really worked! Since the paddlewheel really just has the job to push out the coffee, this apparently can be done by cable ties. It may not be the optimal solution and you can easily print this paddle wheel with a 3D printer or order it at some company, but for me it is enough for now :D

So in general what I wanted to share with this post: Do not give up your equipment because of some mysterious watery coffee! Maybe you have to bring it to someone familiar with machines/repairing (there is a torque limiter inside and some other sensible equipment), but you do not have to throw it out!

Hopefully my experience with this can help some other people to find the courage to repair their coffee machine.

I've recently acquired a full auto (bean to cup), the Delonghi Magnifica S ecam 22.110.b as per the title.

It seemed like an ok auto and had decent reviews, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to make the coffee less acidic. It's so, so bad.

I have the grinder set to the smallest size (and I'll take a picture of the grounds in a bit and update the post), and the temperature set to the maximum, but still the coffee is coming out really bad.

Does anyone have any idea? I've tried two different beans and had similar results (using fresh roasted beans). Is there anything I can do to figure out why the coffee is coming out so bad?

I have recently been exploring different types of coffee roasts, and originally I was drawn towards darker roasts like Kirklands Colombian Supremo Bean Dark Roast. 

However, one day I was in a pinch and needed to get coffee on the go so I decided to stop by 7-11 and look for a similar blend to what I normally get. The choice I went with was the Colombian Medium Roast and I was surprised to find that the coffee had a bit of a fruity taste. Prior to this I had never known that coffee could have a fruity taste and I was honestly confused as to if I was imagining the flavor or if it was a side effect of buying a cheap $1.50 cup of coffee from 7-11. After researching further, I found you guys and this community and realized that there is so much to flavor that I don't know about. My question for you guys is if anyone knows of a good roast to try that can give me a similar fruity flavor in my coffee to the fruity 7-11 blend I tried. I keep craving this fruity flavor whenever I drink the remainder of my 3 month old stale Maxwell house coffee and would love any help towards buying a good, fruity blend.

So far I've only used dunkin' donut k cups with 8oz of water to make a cup and I've enjoyed it and started to appreciate coffee and started looking in into ground coffee and maybe grinding my own beans down the road. 

Last night I bought a bag of WAWA ground coffee and a pack of WAWA K-cups as well. Since I have a reusable cup for the Keurig I can use the ground coffee there but the instructions of the ground coffee bag say 1 TBSP of coffee with 6oz water = 1 cup. The WAWA k-cups I have has 2 TBSP of coffee in it which is the same size my reusable K cup can use and goes with 6oz as well. So my questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. does the ground coffee contain more caffeine in it for it to only say 1 TBSP when the same brand k-cup has 2 TBSP recommended with the same amount of water? Or would 2 TBSP of ground equal about the same as a k-cup?
2. If I put 2TBSP of ground coffee in the reusable cup should I do 12oz of water?
3. Is there anyway to tell how much caffeine I am getting from wawa ground coffee so I can monitor my caffeine intake? Like how much caffeine would be in 1 TBSP of ground? I did a quick google search and first result is like 180mg of caffeine which seems high for 1 TBSP when I also read the that k-cups range from 80-140.

Idk, I'm just confused is all about the amount of ground I should use and the amount of caffeine I should expect since I'd like to stay within a healthy daily range of caffeine intake.",1614028242

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to establish the best equipment mix for our use case, but haven't got there yet. We currently have a close to 10 year old Delonghi Magnifica, which when descaled and clean gives a drinkable coffee. It's super reliable. We buy our beans in the UK from [hasbean.co.uk](https://hasbean.co.uk) tending towards the cheaper end of their range, because I don't think the machine will do more expensive beans justice.

I like either a short black or an espresso and  want to use better beans and to experiment to get a better coffee. 

Is there a machine that is simple to use, can deliver a healthy sized Americano and will allow me to up my coffee game and get the most from more expensive beans? Ease of use for my wife is as important as my flavour hunt.

Coffee,hope_still_flies,lpqjpn,Moka pot questions,"Just got a moka pot (cheap off brand version) and I have some questions. My daily driver is pour over with Kalitta 185, but was occasionally making some faux espresso with the Aeropress. Recently picked up a moka pot to try out making some faux espresso with that since I was a little tired of the labor intensive Aeropress method I had adopted. Tried it out for the first time and was more or less pleased with the outcome considering it was the first try and I hadn't really tried being precise with anything.

I am curious about a couple things though. First, the capacity/ratio. I got what was labeled as a 6 cup. I could only fit about 20 grams of grounds in the chamber (fine espresso grind), and filling to the valve was about 250 ml of water. I didn't measure what the output was, but I'd say maybe there was still maybe a third of the water left at the bottom in the end. I was making for two and I'd guess maybe 75-100 in each cup once poured. So output volume was ok for two (which is what I was expecting from the 6 cup based on my research), but I was surprised at the limited input of coffee. 20 grams to 250ml water, or even the 200ml end result is not very concentrated and overall not much in terms of how much coffee is in the end brew when split between two people (theoretically 10 grams coffee per each). I have to admit I was also surprised that the end result was still rather tasty and when milk was added it was still good, so I guess I should just trust the moka pot and be thankful to be using less coffee (I was using 20 gram to 50ml water for a faux espresso in the Aeropress). But I was wondering what others experiences were in regards to how much grounds you are getting in and/or what overall ratio you end up with.

Second question is how do ya'll fill the grounds chamber without making a huge mess? Any tips?",1614007140

Coffee,muskogeee,lppf9w,Is espresso from a pressurized portafilter better than no espresso? Any recommendations for a machine to pair with Encore?,"So I've seen dozens of YouTube videos and posts on here where coffee aficionado's scoff at the idea of a pressurized portafilter and go on and on in detail about why it's not real espresso and can never be as good, but I haven't seen this question posed before:

Is it still better than having no espresso machine at all?

Does it get you something between like a moka pot and real espresso?   
Is it good enough for sweetened/milk drinks that hide less-than-perfect extraction?

Keep in mind I'm not talking about really cheap $40 WalMart espresso machines here, but higher quality models with pressurized portafilters, or even those that support both regular and pressurized.

If decent results are achievable, can anyone recommend a machine with a pressurized portafilter that pairs well with the Baratza Encore?  Maybe one that supports regular portafilters as well in case I ever graduate to a better grinder that can do proper espresso. 

As for price I'm thinking around the $500 mark but maybe a little higher if needs be.

Coffee,humayunh,lpc5un,Upgrade from a Dedica?,"Hey fellow bean juice makers!
I got into bean juice making ~6-7 months ago, as we all got stuck inside! Anyhow, I not being too sure how it’ll turn out started with a Delonghi Dedica &amp;amp;amp; a JX-pro, bottomless porta filter and a unpressurized basket to go. We (my wife &amp;amp;amp; I) exclusively drink milk based drinks only, and so I make around 2-4 cups a day. Recently I got fed up of hand grinding and decided to get a Eureka Mignon Manualle and couldn’t be happier. 

As you all know how the rabbit hole goes, I’m thinking the better grinder probably deserves a better machine too. The most common starter machines you see are the Silvia And the gaggia. I did some quick review watching from expert bean juicers, like “I’m a fancy man” Hoffman and other friends. The Silvia v6 looks like the winner.

My questions are:

-How much of an improvement am I actually going to see with this upgrade, over my Dedica? Is it going to be worth it (or noticeable?) 

-I understand I might need a PID mod. I’m fine doing it down the road, but might use it stock first 2-3 months. Don’t wanna go Insta-poor.

-How tough is temperature surfing going to be? I’m coming from a Dedica so I probably have crappy temps already though.

-I really like the idea of the heat exchanger machines, like the rocket apartmento, but they are too expensive. I think that’s for a few years down the road.

-How bad is the workflow to make 2-3 lattes back to back? Right now I already do shot/steam/shot/steam on the Dedica by steam mode and then purging water to cool it down, but it’s a thermoblock. Is the wait time much longer on the Silvia?

-I’m also used to being up and running within 2-3 mins. How long is typical startup time for Silvia? I’m seeing ranges from 10-40 mins =/

Coffee,welluhno,lp82e3,[Question] Should I simply ignore extraction time?,"So I'm relatively new to getting into home espresso and still mastering 'dialing in'.  I recently saw a post/gif of someone doing a really long extraction and it blew my mind. Why does everyone always recommend 27-30 second extractions as the norm?

So suddenly, I'm like, why is time even important to aim for? If time is simply the length of time water is in contact with the bean, then isn't that a linear inverse relationship to the amount of yield in the cup? Slower flow rate = smaller yield, faster flow rate = larger yield?

So, if I keep my dose the same, grind size the same, and start my extraction with view to simply go until I have a desired yield based on taste, irrespective of the time it'll take - am I going to get a controllable outcome? Or am I missing something?

Ie - if I control for yield, and adjust grind size to vary the flow rate to get to that yield",1613945681

I've been reading on a lot different grinders lately, as I want my first manual grinder be one that will last for a long time. This is the reason for why I can't make my mind now. For now I only brew using v60 and aeropress, but I'm going to buy a flair pro later this year. And I'm not sure where this will end 😅. 

The grinders I've been reading and watched reviews on are:
Comandante C40: Seems like a favorite for most people

1zpresso:
A lot of people here recommend Jx Pro it for its quality and price. But I like K-plus the magnetic catcher and that you can exchange grinder steps on top. Design-wise I would prefer it if it looked more like the JPpro model.

Timemore:
I just found the Chestnut X. I like it design-wise and specs looks good. But I haven't found any reviews on this one (except some Asian YT videos). Has anyone here tried it and compared it to the other ones?
I'm also big fan of Chestnut G1 design, but not sure about how it compares to the rest. 

Price for the Comandante here in Norway is about 305 usd from Norwegian web store.
Price for the 1zpresso is according to the web prices I've seen at 1zpresso's website + vat (25% here and an amount the shipper takes when it arrives, usually around 24 usd).

Please help me decide 😅 is it worth paying almost the double for comandante c40/kplus than Jx Pro? Is the Chestnut G1 even in the same league as the other ones? Should I wait for more reviews of the Chestnut X?",1613943912

Coffee,-Tommy,lp551m,"JX-Pro, M47 Pheonix/Simplicity, or Comandante MK3 for V60, Aeropress, Espresso"," Hello everyone, I am looking for a new grinder, primarily for V60 and Aeropress but purchasing a Flair soon too so espresso capability is a must. I grind 2 cups at a time (me and my spouse) so 30-35/40g capacity is ideal.

Currently  I have a Porlex JP30 that I got to “dip my toe” in hand grinding at the start or quarentine. It was great to start with and learn, but it’s slow and produces a lot of fines. I've gotten some great cups but I also get lots of muddy cups with lots of fines at the same setting. I also find it frustrating that it’s hard to tell where you are at in terms of grind level with no numbers/labels/easy to find “0” spot on  the grinder.

I am currently looking at:

JX-Pro from 1zpresso.

M47 Phoenix.

Comandante mk3.

JX-Pro looks like a great grinder for the price, but I can’t find much info on it. I like the look, reviews say it is fast, and the dial looks easy to read to jump between grind sizes. I saw some critics say that it is just okay for pourovers as there are a lot of fines. 

M47 looks nice and I love that it is (near) step less with an easy to  read dial. It is, however, mostly plastic with pretty big price jumps for metal. I would be willing to make the jump though.

Commandante looks the best IMO. I have heard the best things about it, but it looks a pain to adjust the grind level as you cannot see what you level is.

Coffee,LC_DMV,lp0h1v,Made my first v60,"I’ve gotten into coffee the last couple of months and have explored a few different coffee techniques. I started my journey with a French press. Then an aeropress. I then went on to try the bodum pour over which I just didn’t like. Due to my dislike for the pour over, I went to the clever dripper with fond memories of my previous immersion brews. Over that time I went from pre ground coffee. To fresh beans using a blade grinder. Then a timemore c2. Which I eventually upgraded to my current 1zpresso JX Pro. Well over the weekend I decided to give pour over another try but with a v60. Today I made my first cup out of the v60. It is so beautiful. The subtle flavors and pleasant bitterness of the coffee that were blunted by the clever dripper and masked by the sweetness and earthiness of immersion brewing now come to the front of the cup. This is, despite being my first v60 brew, my favorite cup of coffee to date. I’ll still go back to my immersion brewers (wether my aeropress or clever dripper) from time to time. But I don’t see anything becoming my daily driver ahead of the v60.",1613924568
Coffee,s2alexan,lozd01,Is there a pour over cone that is sized for 4-6 cup paper basket coffee filters?,"Sometimes I want to make more coffee than I can fit in my v60 but I still really like doing a manual pour over and don't want a drip machine. But I can't find any kind of holder for 4-6 cup flat bottom basket coffee filters (a very common type for auto drip machines). I feel like something like this should exist but I can't find anything. I suppose I could buy a drip machine and then throw out everything but the plastic basket filter holder but that seems wasteful. And it would be ugly. I'm also considering asking an etsy seller who makes ceramic pour over cones to make me a custom one. Is there anyone else who wants to make larger pour overs than fit in the single cup filters? What do you use?

I have a chemex but it has the same problem as the v60, bed depth of the grounds is too high and I have to grind coarser and I don't get as good extraction as my v60. I feel the larger flat bottom shape is ideal for larger volumes.",1613921462

Coffee,WoweeBlowee,lonvtx,Why Your K-Cup Coffee Might Sort of Suck,"Hey, /r/coffee. I've been an avid coffee drinker for years now, and have incrementally gotten into more and more intense methods of brewing and eventually even home roasting. I've got half a kitchen worth of coffee equipment, and I even work-- admittedly only tangentially-- in the industry. But it all started when my aunt gave me a Keurig brewer as a going-to-college present nearly a decade ago, and so maybe I've got maybe a kind of soft spot in my heart for these things. I know that Keurig and Keurig-like appliances, as a brew method, have *plenty* of problems to delve into-- temperature, brew time, poor quality beans, actual waste, you name it. But I wanted to cover something far more glaring that I've noticed only recently, on-the-job: **K-Cups Have Like Holy Shit No Coffee In Them, Or At Least Way Less Than The Average End User Expects/Needs**

OK, so: The SCA recommends 55g of coffee per 1000g of water. Your average ""coffee mug"" type coffee cup holds something like \~350g of water/coffee/liquid. Based on the SCA ratio, this means that you need 19.25g of coffee for a typical coffee cup. With this in mind, a cursory glance at K-Cup pods on store shelves or even on Keurig's own website is pretty hair-raising: These K-Cups have around 13-14g of coffee in them, on the *very high* side, more like an average of 12g, and as little as 9g. ***Nine grams.*** I've seen 36-count bulk boxes of these things selling for nearly $30 with a net weight of something like 15oz, when that same amount of that same coffee would sell for half that price if it was in a Good Old Bag™. Meanwhile, these brewers have default settings in the 8-10oz range, so that they'll brew to fill a-- you guessed it-- standard American coffee cup.

The point here is that, even if you're not super pretentious about your coffee, if you regularly use a Keurig brewer and you're using one coffee pod to brew something like 8-10oz of water, then your coffee is coming out massively underextracted; it's quite literally ""watered down."" It seems that the average K-cup is best portioned for about 6oz of water, and if you adjust your brewer accordingly, you may notice a distinct difference in flavor.",1613877944

I practice my technique a bit, but somehow blooming never worked well. Every time I poured water on the coffee grounds, it just ran straight trough. I adjusted the grind size a bit finer, and finally it *just barely* absorbed enough water to bloom for 20 seconds or so.

This week I finally got through my old bags and bought a new bag of beans. And holy shit, now suddenly blooming is so easy. Just pouring like 30-40g of water on 15g of coffee is plenty, whereas with my old beans I could barely make it with 60g of water.

I've spent hours already scouring this forum and looking up roasters such as Klatch, Heart, B&amp;W, ect. 

Our last order was from Klatch where I enjoyed their Mocha Java (my wife did not), My wife like the Rainforest blend which I was lukewarm about. 

I don't think we like very fruit forward or florally flavors (say that five times fast haha). 

Also, we are looking for a daily drinker here and not something too pricey, &lt; $20/12oz coffee everyday. 

We'd really appreciate any recommendations.",1609985209
Coffee,LitroPack,ks2yzl,I have less than 24 hours to prepare to make 20 cups of coffee. See parameters in text.,"Title.

So I have a new job and people in the office were very interested with the short bio about me and my coffee that I wrote for myself in the company website. They wanted to have a taste and so I took up the challenge to make coffee just this one time, or should I probably postpone it until the next working day so I could prepare and secure more gear (just filters and more coffee really)?

I own a:

* Comandante C40

* V60 01 with barely enough filters

* Kalita Wave 155 and 185 but no filters

* A Fellow Stagg EKG and a Hario Buono 1L

* Likely not enough coffee (I ain't sharing my Geshas, sorry)
* Hario 450ml decanter (likely 50ml less than the planned 500ml per brew, but still actually fits)

My plan of attack is as follows given what I have now:

* Pour-over
* 200ml/12.5g (1:16) serves for each person
* with the V60 01, brew 3 cups every 5 minutes (is it possible?)
* Coarser grind, enough to keep the entire brewing process drip within 02:30
* 100c temp just to be sure
* No time to use fancy water, just tap
* 30 minutes to brew everything?

What can I do to make the entire duration less miserable and more efficient?",1609984841

Also I love the flavored coffees but the flavors always seem so subtle. I recently got a refillable pod and some canned coffee because that's cheaper to do that way and the flavors are amazing. I can smell and taste the flavors really well. Maybe it's a brand issue. It's Don Francisco's. The prefilled pods are Starbucks. Don is definitely better but I don't know if it's the brand or the fact that isn't not prefilled? I don't even add much cream to Don's because I don't want to dilute the wonderful flavors.",1609983341

My machine is 7 years old and has had this issue come and go with no obvious reason or fix. Every time the problem returns I check on google to see if anyone has worked it out yet, and now someone has so I thought I’d share since I’ve seen others on r/coffee with this problem.

Full credit to MrG over at [coffeeforums.co.uk](https://coffeeforums.co.uk/topic/49428-water-won%E2%80%99t-stop-flowing-automatically/?do=findComment&amp;comment=792698) who figured out it’s not the flow meter itself but the connection pins.
He made a nice guide with pictures [here](https://share.nuclino.com/p/Sage-Barista-Express---Flow-meter-pin-11Ho6ijgOkhDr97DmaOWV8). 
I followed his steps and it worked like a charm, my machine is auto stopping again! If your machine is older like mine you’ll find 3 screw covers and screws in step 6 and none in step 7, but otherwise everything else was the same.

Coffee,midnightlounger,krzkga,Question about sub 10g brews,"Hello all, 

I have been surfing around the subreddit for a while now and started diving into making more coffee at home. 

I have been curious to ask if anyone here have much experiences with sub 10g brews. 

As well curious if there a method that favors smaller brews? i.e. 7.5-8g for a (1/4 cup/125ml) of coffee? Does coffee brewing even scale down well that low? Would be interesting to hear thoughts on this. Or could it be that at under 10grams there is simply not enough heat in the water for the duration of the brew time for a proper extraction? 

As much as I love the smell and taste of coffee in the morning I am rather sensitive to caffeine. Regular serving sizes (1cup/250ml/8oz) 15-20g at 1:16 simply makes too much coffee for me to comfortably drink in a sitting. I have resorted to saving the remaining coffee for the following day, warming it up in the microwave with some milk and sugar. I hate to waste coffee. 

Currently I use an old French press. Frequently finding my brews to be sour (perhaps under extracted from such small volumes?). I purchased a 1spresso jx pro from rogue wave up here in Canada as a Christmas present to myself to get better grind consistency, perhaps I have not been able to dial in the settings. 

I am looking at the following as possible alternatives to my French press

* Kalita wave 155 in sandstone.
* Hario V60 01 Clear plastic 
* Hario Switch 

I am leaning to the Kalita 155 as reviews of its easy brew consistency is appealing especially since I am not the most coordinated in the morning. As well  I am concerned about the potential ability to brew in the V60 well consistently with only 125g of water to work with. 

Will definitely purchase a goose neck kettle to have steady pours. 

I'd love to hear your experiences. Cheers.",1609974224

Coffee,QuasiBonsaii,krt8nv,Help repairing a broken Steam Wand for the Iberital IB7!,"Hiya folks,

I've got a 3 group Iberital IB7, with 2 steam wands. Recently however, the left hand steam wand dial started getting stuck occasionally, but now it's almost completely stuck. It can turn maybe 3/4 of a complete rotation, but not enough to start the steam, as that needs at least a full rotation, if not more. I popped the dial off, and underneath I could see the steam valve insert. The little snap washer was bent out of shape, which I believe is what caused the dial to jam. [Here is an example of the full insert,](https://www.espressounderground.co.uk/VALVE-INSERT-ORIGINAL-PN-IB2383-p/ib2383.htm) and the washer sits at the front of that [and looks like this, but brass.](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-51wyxax1je/images/stencil/original/products/97102/52576/703432_1__47367.1583861789.jpg?c=2) The technical diagrams are [available online](https://www.iberital.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/iberital-IB7.pdf), and on page 4, you can see exactly the part I'm trying to describe.

So, my first question is can I just replace the washer? I removed the washer, and then from comparison to the non-faulty wand, I bent it back into shape, but was unable to snap it back onto the valve insert. Would the insert need to be disassembled to pop the washer back into place? Secondly, since the replacement insert is only £14, I might just go for that, but if I did would it just be as simple as unscrewing the old valve and screwing the new one on? [A youtube tutorial I found suggests that to be the case,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-u6f_NdgKE) but I wanted to check regardless. Would I need to turn off the machine and wait for it to cool down? Lastly, because I don't want to throw £50 away for the official tool, does anyone know what size socket I would need to remove the insert? I have an embarrassingly incomplete socket set at home, so might need to buy the right size separately.

Hopefully I've not just written a bunch of nonsense, I know absolutely nothing about machine servicing, so for all I know I'm completely on the wrong track!",1609956034

Whenever I try to steam milk, there isn't much pressure, there is no whirlpooling, and it runs out of pressure quickly. I've seen that there is a trick to start steaming before the indicator light goes on, but that doesn't make much of a difference when I've tried it.


In order to get any semblance of pressure, I need to brew the espresso first. If I turn on the machine and let it warm up, and then try to steam first, I'll only get the odd bubble or two and then it sputters out. I get a steady stream of water if I turn on the brewing and steam switch though.

Coffee,tauhammerhead,krjhzb,Scientific comparison of Aeropress and Stovetop coffee,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 people’s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought I’d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: I’m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isn’t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear people’s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609920351

So I got a V60 for christmas and have been going wild with experimentation. I've mostly been following James Hoffmann's recipe but have also tried Scott Rao's and the 4:6 method. I recently tried some beans from a friend where the head roaster recommended a coarse grind, 1:13 ratio, aiming for a brew time of 2 minutes. I thought, this must be a mistake, because every recipe I've found calls for medium-fine grind setting. I figured, the roaster must know these beans better than anyone else, so let's try it out. To my surprise, it was amazing. I was blown away by the brightness from the cup yet it tasted balanced and not overly acidic. I then for kicks brewed the beans with the James Hoffmann method and ratio and it tasted awful. I feel like this roasters method breaks everything I've learned about V60's so far.

It is currently on week 3 after roast and I am having trouble dialing it in. I am using the newer JX Pro (Grey Dot) at a 33 setting - 3 rotations and 3 numbers and a Hario Switch. My grinder’s zero is at 2, so technically I am at 3 rotations and 1 number in reality. I am following the Hoffmann recipe of 15g to 250g boiling water, 2 min steep, stir, 15 sec pause after stirring and drawdown. I have the untabbed Hario filters and am getting a slightly less than one minute drawdown. The aroma of the coffee is straight up raspberry, but the cup tastes rather one dimensional. I tried going two clicks finer and hit that wall of bitterness. Any tips in helping me dial in the coffee more? Should I go slightly coarser? 

Thank you

Coffee,GhoulStoic,krgu5f,"Noob here, why does my drip coffee sometimes vaguely smell like a barnyard or sweat or a little like a wet dog?","I've been drinking coffee for years from the shops and making instant coffee at home. Just a few months ago I finally got a coffee maker and started making brewed coffee. I just use the cheap 5 dollar kroger generic brand coffee. I live in vegas where we have hard water with lots of chlorine and I just use the tap water to make my coffee. 

Sometimes I notice, usually on my second cup, that when I go to take a sip I get a smell of like a barnyard or sweat. It seems like it floats to the top of the coffee and sits on the top so if I stir it or drink the ikcky top layer it kind of goes away. 

Recently I read a reddit comment from someone who lives in Seattle and they said they lived between some wholesale coffee bean factories and it would all produce a manure like smell especially in the morning.

We had some Folgers Silk that's been hanging around for too long, so I used 67 grams of that with about 1010 grams of water.

I have a lot to learn, but this first pot is very promising.  This doesn't taste like any coffee I've ever had before.

I booked the water in a long-necked tea pot, then set it aside to let it cool for a few seconds.  I think I'm going to drill the lid so I can use a meat thermometer to get the right temperature.

First pour to cover the grounds, wait 45 seconds, then continue pouring to get a kilo of water.

I have not been able to locate the original recipe, but I have since added and subtracted from it to make my own version of it. The result of this recipe is a cup that is very fruity, light, and sometimes sour depending on the roast but never bitter. And, it’s a piece of cake!

18 grams medium-coarse grind (~30 on Baratza Encore)
80 grams “cold” water, initial pour
150 grams “hot” water, final pour
(230 grams water total)

1. Start with an inverted aeropress. Pour 18 grams coffee, shake to even out. 

2. Pour 80 grams of room-temperature (~75 F) water, stir with spoon to wet grounds evenly.

3. Set timer for 4 minutes. 

4. Bring additional water to 190 F. 

5. After the 4 minutes are up, pour 150 grams of 190 F water. Stir with spoon to wet grounds evenly. 

6. Set timer for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. 

7. After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, invert aeropress and purge. 

Enjoy!

The strange thing about this recipe is that it uses two different water temperatures, long brew times, and a coarse grind, all of which are unusual for the aeropress. Nevertheless, this is usually my go-to recipe.",1610735244

I went ahead and ordered a chemex, a hand grinder, a gooseneck electric kettle and some beans. While I wait for my supplies to arrive I have been researching brew methods and have a few questions. 

1. Should I absolutely be using a thermometer? Or is the water boiling a good enough indicator of temperature?
2. Should I return my electric kettle to the on position in between pours? Or is the temperature loss looked at as being negligible?
3. Is the freshness of brewed coffee important? Is it bad practice to brew in the morning and store in a thermos and then drink the coffee up to two hours later at work? 
4. What brewing method would you recommend? Should the method change depending on the beans? I have ordered a bag of Doma Chronic Super Dank and Airship Sumatra Kerinci Honey. 
5. What is the general consensus on metal pour over filters? From what I can tell the resistance is different from paper filters. I have ordered paper filters, but am curious if metal is a good option.

Coffee,Environmental_Cut257,kxtqjo,Breville Barista Express Noob,"Hello everyone, hope you guys can give me some feedback on why this is the case.

  
Just to give you some insight on how I use the machine.  I pull 18 grams of beans, weighted before grind and grind them into a cup. I use a tooth pick to fluff it up and break up the clumps and then transfer the ground coffee into my portafilter, (dual shot, single wall) with my funnel.   I then use the crema distribution/tamp tool to distribute first and then tamp down to the measurement of 7.5mm, which matches the razor tool.  I then use the razor tool anyway to make sure it's the right height.  I then purge the head and heat the glass, then carefully attach the portafilter and pull the shot, timing it and watching the pressure carefully.

&amp;#x200B;

I've watched alot of videos and done my research, I think I am doing things as well as possible now and I can get a great pressure and pull, (waiting on my naked/bottomless portafilter to really dial everything in).  

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I am having is that I have to set my grinder to a ridiculous level.  I almost always have to go to 4, this seems strange to me as nearly every video I've watched they start at 10 or 9 and maybe dial it to 8 max.   My extraction times aren't amazing either always falling short and the puck, while a nice form when dumped, seems a bit wetter than it should be, (not dripping or anything but just visually damp).  

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is the grind having to be that fine.   I opened the hop up, and there's heaps of shrapnel all around the rim, even whole beans.  Is my grinder busted, do I need to do some kind of configuration?  The grinder is set to 6 internally, which I believe is the default and should be fine for a brand new machine, (well going on to just under a month now).  Am I still doing something wrong?  I am more than happy to record myself going through all the motions.

  
I have tried 4 different coffees, 1 store bought and 3 premium, freshly roasted coffees and if I grind at anything over 5 on the dial the pressure is terrible, anything near 10 and it's sour and the pressure doesn't even enter the dark gauge.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have used the double wall single shot with no grinds to check the pressure and it seems fine.  I'm at a loss.  I am assuming its me who's in the wrong, but could it be that the grinder is faulty?  Is there any test I can do to find out?   I would hate to think I've gone to all this effort and the reason my coffee isn't getting to where I want it to be is a dodgy grinder.

&amp;#x200B;

Again I accept it could be me, but I'm not getting consistent shots and from what I read the grinder should be quite noticeably different with just 1 step up or down but if I go from a 4, (purge the grinder with 10 grams of beans), to a 6 the pressure doesn't really move negatively, but then sometimes it does....I really am at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I have to set my grinder to a ridiculously, normally way too fine setting to get decent pressure and I believe I am doing a good job of using the machine, how can I test my grinder to see if it's faulty or what could I be doing better.",1610714318

Coffee,Right_Explanation270,kxre6n,Upgrade from Porlex mini,"Hi,

I started getting really into coffee and bought a v60 recently. I've had an aeropress from about a year that I used with the porlex mini grinder and had pretty good results but I feel like I can't get a good cup with the V60 (might be because I suck at It too haha).

That's why I'm looking to upgrade my grinder and wanted to know If you guys thought the Timemore Slim was a good option. I've done some research and found that It was quite good, while not as good as the comandante. I don't really know If I want to put 220$ in a grinder especially since I don't plan on doing espresso (mostly V60, aeropress and maybe french press once in a while).

Yes, the Kompresso can actually theoretically make 9 bars, but it only has a metal screen in the portafilter so it depends entirely on grind size to control extraction. Thus, a good grinder is necessary. Other portable espresso machines like the Nanopresso and Staresso have pressurized portafilter valves and aren't as dependent on grind size.

I need a small hand grinder that is capable of grinding espresso level fineness consistently.

Timemore Nano - available everywhere in Asia, but stepped burrs means you can't dial in the grind size precisely

Aergrind - due to COVID, very difficult to get

r/coffee in particular seems to hold the idea that most coffee in the US is bad, but that doesn't seem to be the case according to the SCA. 

However, there is one sentence that would have clarified this article:

""It is important to keep in mind that this data is based on the consumers’ perception of ‘specialty’. ""

But then again

""Extracting and interpreting data from the NCDT report, the SCA has developed an infographic that paints a picture of specialty coffee consumption in the U.S. over time.""

Coffee,ClientGlittering9996,kxizwm,Breville Barista Express - Cannot Dial In (2-4s blonding)," 

Hi everyone,

I would really appreciate some advice.

I have tried everything (Or so I think) to dial in my new Breville machine (3 weeks old) but have failed

I have gone through a systematic approach of adjusting Grind and dose to try and get the right yield and shot times.

I have used 3 different types of Beans from highly reputable local roasters (Single O and Triple Pick - all fresh 2-10 days old) - Note: started dialling in from scratch with each new bean type hoping it was the beans at first

I am weighing the dose and have played around with the 16-18g ranges in

I have adjusted the grind, both the internal and external Burr to try and get the right setting

I have even tried to adjust temperature

I am aiming for \~1:2 ratio (17-18g in - 36-40g out)

**In all cases the coffee starts nice and slow for about 2-4s (dark, thick) then its like the machine makes a sound, the flow goes instantly blonde and speeds up significantly (This happens when over extracted with clear channelling and when under extracted with low to no pressure)**

**I also cannot get extraction times above 18-20s (from pressing the button) without channelling, as soon as I try to go for higher extraction times I cannot manage without a bitter over extracted shot**

I would really appreciate some advice,

* Why is my coffee blonding so quickly?
* How can I up extraction times without getting an over extracted and bitter shot?

Hoping the coffee gods can help me :)",1610671192

So I bought a really great Ethiopian light/medium roast from my local coffee shop here in New Jersey.  Been grinding it around 17-20 with my Baratza Encore.  

I'm also using the partial infusion method with my Moccamaster KB 741 where I'll close the filter off for the first 30 seconds of the brew while stirring the slurry.  

I've brewed this coffee about three times and all three times I've has close calls with the filter basket almost overfilling.

Today I made 1L with 57 grams of coffee ground at 18 on my Baratza.  I had a mess after my coffee stopped dripping.  Total clog...needed to stop the MM and transfer coffee in the filter basket to a pitcher and then transfer the wet grounds to a fresh filter basket where it eventually finished.

I've read on this forum that some origins/roasts produce more fines with Ethiopian being one of them - this makes sense for the clogging and slow drip time

I'm guessing that I need to either stop using the partial infusion method with my MM when brewing Ethiopian or grind much courser.

I'd always enjoyed a good cup of coffee when I was out, but never really bothered to make it at home.  I decided to change that this year.

I purchased a Technivorm Moccamaster KBT-741 and a Baratza Encore, after doing a bit of research on the best gear in my price point.  I also went to a local roaster to pick up some of their beans.

I think I have made one good pot of coffee in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong with the others.  The problem I am having is that, no matter what I'm modifying, the water seems to just be pouring through too quickly.  I have tried grinding finer, but it's still dumping through in less than 4:30.

I am using the (essentially) 18:1 ratio recommended by Moccamaster, and am using a digital scale.  Notably, I am using 41.5 grams of beans to 750 ml of water.  I have tried grind settings from 22 to 18, all of which result in the exact same drip time.

The process I have been using is to close the drip for the first 30 seconds of the process.  At 15 seconds, I give the wet grind a little stir, and let the coffee bloom a little.  At 30 seconds, I open it to half (as recommended for 750 ml), and let it pour through.  I start the timer once the water first hits the grind and stop it once the water sinks through the top of the bed.

All of my batches are impossibly sour, like someone has poured lemon juice into my cup.  I know I need to get it to extract longer (5:30-6 minutes, I think) but grind size hasn't really made a difference.  I've even seen posts recommending grinds as coarse as 24 or 26 on the Encore for the Moccamaster.

I have started drinking coffee, mainly milk coffee a few years ago. I started joining the field of filter coffee (mainly hand drip) last year. I noticed one thing I can't really find an answer on.

""Why is there very few blend coffees beans for filter brewing?""

There are both blend and single origin coffee for espresso brewing, though a majority of coffee shops serve blend for espresso-based drinks. What I understand is that most shops look for a balanced flavour in espresso, so they would blend 2-4 different beans (both origin and variety) into an espresso blend. But quite some coffee shops serve SOE as well. In-fact, the best espresso-based coffee I tasted is made with Hatch's El Paraiso 720hour fermentation Geisha. 

But this is not the case in filter brewing. The trend seems to be: Filter coffee is a better way to showcase what the best coffee beans can taste, so there is little point blending different beans. On the other hand, will blend coffee beans actually give a boost to some inferior beans to give a more complex flavour in filter brewing as well? I know a few foreign coffee shops sell blend coffee beans for filter brewing, but little or none is doing that in Hong Kong? Is there anything I overlooked?

Maybe 2 mugs a day, max, so I don't need a whole 12-cup drip machine. My roommate has a Keurig with the ""use your own"" coffee thingy, but I find Keurig coffee plastic-y to my taste.

So... I don't know what the hell to do. I *was* gonna use my Espro travel press, but after two days I remembered why I stopped using it because it's a massive pain to clean. It felt like I was spending more time cleaning then drinking coffee it. And as much as I'm all about a very good cup of coffee, a V60 sounds like something I'd have to concentrate on. I can barely walk in the morning, let alone carefully pour out things to specific grams or whatever. Probably shouldn't even trust myself with pouring boiling water, honestly.

Coffee,heklin0,kx8dq2,Story Time: Starbucks vs Single Origin Craft,"I hope stories are allowed here. Haven't seen many, but don't see it in the rules not to. TLDR at bottom. 


A bit of backstory first. We had just moved homes into a bug infested apartment. While we dealt with that, I took my espresso machine to work to protect it. (We left the apt, sued, won a lot of money, for those that are curious).


I am known as the coffee guy at work. There are a handful of folks that I will make drinks for when I'm not busy. 2 of them are good work friends. There's Jack who loves trying new things and while he doesn't want to spend his life on coffee, he's always asking questions and wanting to try new coffees I get. Then there's Chas. She just recently got a Moka Pot and I'm so proud of her...unfortunately this story was two years ago and she was far from today. Here we go. 


I invited Jack and Chas to my office to try some espresso. They had just made a Starbucks run, but they wanted some anyways. I was happy to oblige since they'd be able to compare Starbuck to real coffee. At this point, Jack has finished his drink but Chas brought hers with her. 


I begin getting the shots prepped and ready to be pulled while explaining what I'm doing and how espressos are made. Jack asks questions, Chas watches and listens. 


Drinks are made. They're just straight espresso since I didn't have any milk at work. I try mine. It's good. Jack tries his. He really likes it and starts trying to figure out notes. Chas.....pours it into her Starbucks drink. 


I'll wait a few seconds to let you mull that over. 


She poured my beautiful craft espresso.... into her iced coffee from Starbucks. 


I just stare. Jack, thank goodness for Jack, says ""Chas, what the hell did you just do?"" 


Chas, not starring at her cup in shock: I- I don't know why I just did that. Why did I-....


She looks up at me, me still in silence: I'm so sorry! I don't know what just happened. I- Do you want me to leave? 


Me: No, it's fine. Your drink was almost empty anyways. Maybe you'll be able to taste it. 


Jack starts asking me questions while I start cleaning up. It's kind of awkward for a bit. They leave. 


I still invite them for coffee, but Chas never shows up. Early last year. Jack was OOO, and I invited Chas to try a new coffee I got. She refused, but I insisted. When I was making it (pour over this time), I asked why she never came. Still, to that day, she felt bad. I didn't realize it, but I told her not to worry about it. She now jokes about it when we get coffee, and Jack gives her a hard time about it, too. Good news is, she really likes the coffee I make. Bad news, she still gets Starbucks. Haha! 


TL/DR: I make a SO espresso for a friend...she pours it into her Starbucks drink.",1610639910
Coffee,BilledConch8,kx88rr,Newbie tasting help,"Hello! I recently dove into the coffee game with a Baratza virtuoso burr grinder and am using a local roaster but my coffee is tasting very ""off"". I'm not sure how to approach this and looking for some advice.

My usual method is to use a Melita plastic pour over with paper filters, ~1 tbsp of coffee beans for ~8oz of water, using an electric gooseneck kettle with temp control (at ~205 degree F). I use the grinder on setting 20.

The funny thing is that the local roaster seems to have a bitterness to the coffee, almost like milk chocolate, which I am not a fan of. This isn't ideal and I'm seeing a lot of beans are roasted with ""chocolate"", and the generic grocery store coffee beans taste better to me than the local roaster.

I hear local roasters are the way to go but I'm not convinced. Does anyone have a similar experience with ""chocolate"" roasted coffee notes, or am I a victim of a bad palette?

Thank you!",1610639490
Coffee,Lordmuchnis,kx7zr5,V60 Ultimate Hoffman method for 24g of coffee beans [questions],"So this idea came from the amount of coffee. I think that the final amount is too large. So I tried to change it. I did basic math in terms of how many coffee and water should I use. But Im not sure about time. So tell me if the time should be changed or still. And also, this is just experiment and Im sorry if this similar thing was posted before.

Ratio: 24g of coffee : 400g of water

Time: 0:00
Add 2 times the water for blooming phase
(it should be 48g, but 60 wont get on 3 times the water. Although more acidic parts will get into drink with 60g of water.) Mix it with swirl and let it bloom for 45s.

Time: 0:45
Add 60% of the final drink (keep in mind you already added 48g for bloom), which is 240g. 
So you should add 192g of water in next 30s. Flow rate is 6,4g/s.

Time: 1:15
Add water that aims for 100% of the drink. You should add 160g of water in next 30s. Flow rate 5,3g/s.

Time: 1:45
Stirr it with spoon 2x clockwise, 2x anti-clockwise. Let it draw-down a bit and give it one last gentle swirl to knock of grounds from a wall. And wait for draw-down.

And here comes my question again. How the draw-down should be long? Have I done everything right or has it been complete mistake? Please let me know.
Also if you make it to the end, you are the best. And Im sorry for the way I wrote it so ask me for some missinderstandings.",1610638726

I make large batches so aeropress isn't used much. My v60 just tastes ""meh"" to me now. I'm using james hoffmans method. When I get the same coffee as a hand pour from the local shop it tastes amazing but mine doesn't really have any forward notes. It just tastes bland to me. I have a Kinu m47 hand grinder and have been dialing the grind as far down as possible without bitterness. The french press is alright but it's not my favorite (using james hoffmans method as well). I mainly use it during work hours as it doesn't require much attention so I can continue to work. I find myself wanting to explore more ways to brew.

Coffee,dele_20,kx3nqq,Moka Pot conundrum,"Hello folks
I recently purchased a 2 cup variant of the Bialetti Moka pot. After seasoning the pot as per instructions, my first 3-4 times resulted in a glorious brew. The coffee used to come out of the pot with a very slight hissing/spluttering followed by a glorious brown-honey colored thick brew with ""crema"" or whatever espresso esque characteristic it might provide. Safe to say it was hella satisfying 
However after 15 days of use, I'm still getting decent coffee from it but the coffee just trickles out into the upper container, no bubbles, no glorious fake crema. Just a steady brown trickle. I cleaned the gasket and metal filter quite regularly and I have doubts if they've become lose? Or maybe is it to do with my coffee (preground, i apologise but gotta make do) getting older and hence the lack of aesthetic while brewing. 
Sorry for the long message, would love to discuss it. As an engineer, nothing gives me more satisfaction than to consistently achieve perfect brews on finicky equipment",1610622536

Coffee,tururut_tururut,kx32hs,Rant inside - increasingly frustrated with the Chemex,"I bought a 3-cup chemex a few months ago and I'm getting more and more frustrated with it every day that passes, to the point I've pretty much stopped using it. I've gotten some good cups out of it, and these are really good, like a white wine or a very good German Pilsner. However, most cups are flat, underextracted, hollow, or sometimes even both underextracted and overextracted (sour and weak but astringent).

I try to follow the same routine than in my V60 or Kalita wave (two big pours, more or less like Scott Rao's new technique but it either drains crazy fast or chokes and it's quite hard not to get dry pockets on the bloom phase.

Was it ever really good coffee or good espresso?

Or was it that the general American public didn’t really know any better around 92 or so. But now in 2021, the general American public has a much better understanding and appreciation for quality coffee?

Or is it that since they began to expand outside of Washington, they were going for a McDonald’s approach?

Coffee,Robdiesel_dot_com,kwwcwc,I love my Philips LatteGo 3200 (the one with the milk container),"Repost: I think I messed up by including a link in the previous post. 


To begin with, I am NOT a coffee guy in any way.  I've tried stuff like the AeroPress my stepdad gave me - cool, but no need.  Regular Gevalia free 14 cup machine? Great, does what I need it to do.  French Press? Meh.  Pour-over?  I like it. 

What I ended up settling on after trying a few machines and methods was to use my Gevalia machine as a pour-over.  I'd boil water in the electric kettle, then either pour it over, or fill the filter and add coffee and let it sit for a minute to steep, and then stick the cup in beneath and let it drain. 

Sticking the cup in pushes on the same level to open the basket as the carafe does, so it worked great for blooming etc. 

Anyway, I'd microwave some milk in a cup, use my little IKEA frother ($3) and fluff the milk, then add the coffee to it.  Done. 

Then a friend had the LatteGo 3200 at his house and I was intrigued.  He made me a cup and it was good AND stupid simple to clean. 

I ended up buying one not long after. I could always return it if it wasn’t as good as it appeared.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s really easy to unpack, the machine was in a bag with handles, to make it easy to get out of the box. Thank you, Philips! Peel off some protective tape, wash the water and milk compartments, soak the water filter and connect everything and plug it in.

The first few cups of coffee were disappointing, but reading a few reviews indicated that the machine adjusts and “breaks in” after which it will produce a consistent and good coffee. This seems to be correct. The coffee pucks came out drier and more solid after about 10 cups. The coffee tasted richer and better than with our usual pour-over method.

The 3200 is the one with the milk container. There are other “lesser” models using a steam wand instead. My understanding from comparing features and parts is that this is a Gaggia Anima Class or Saeco PicoBaristo in a more convenient packaging.

EDIT:  I forgot to add, this thing only adds beans from a non-hinged lid on top, so you don't need a whole lot of space above it to add beans.   Everything else comes out the front or right side.  Also, very little steam comes out of the pre-ground coffee slot, so no worry about warping a too-close cabinet above it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Even regular coffee comes out tasting great** (compared to my usual heathen-made coffee). I can only assume it’s related to the 15 bar / 218 psi scalding hot water it pushes through the beans.

**The milk frother is extremely simple to use**. Fill with desired amount of milk (real milk, almond, oat or whatever variety, it seems to froth them all very well), simply hang it on the protruding steam spigot, and make your coffee.
Besides the pointless lid, it’s two parts, and they rinse/wash easily, and they’re dishwasher safe too.


**Cleanup is simple**. The drip tray slides out along with the cup for the used pucks. Both the tray and cup are dishwasher safe. A quick rinse when you empty it during the week, and run them in the dishwasher every weekend and they are good as new.  The group also rinses easily under the tap. 

&amp;nbsp;

#####A few annoyances:

&amp;nbsp;

**It uses a lot of water**. There’s the rinse when you start it up. Then the steam for the milk froth, the water for the coffee itself, plus the waste water in the tray. Then when it shuts off, it does a quick flush too.
The flushes and wasted water up to about a cup of water that doesn’t make coffee.

**The milk container leaves a little milk in the bottom even when it’s empty**. What I’d like to see here is a tapered ‘floor’ so every drop of milk is funneled down to the siphon hole.


**Another milk container issue is the lid**. I don’t really see a need for it. It’s not hinged or tethered to the container or the bracket the container snaps into. Since you fill with milk, make coffee and then remove it to wash it, the lid really serves no purpose.
I think even if it were hinged and attached, it would probably be in the way more than anything.

**The indicator lines**, both on the milk container and to a degree the water container, are too hard to see. I’ve attached small strips of tape to make easy-to-see fill marks.
It’s not as vital on the water container as you fill it to “full enough, but not so much that you spill” and that’s fine.


**The drip tray gets a lot of water in it**, even if you, like me, put a little cup to catch the pre- and post-coffee flushes. The indicator for that is a little float that rises up and alerts you, but by the time it floats up the tray is full enough to make it a very careful walk to the sink to avoid spilling.

**Travel mugs** – it’s not quite tall enough to accommodate them, which I think is strange in this day and age. My favorite mug fits under with a slight tilt, but otherwise I’d have to just make one or two cups of coffee and pour it into the travel mug.


#####A few things I learned. 

**DO NOT put pre-ground coffee in before you’ve turned on the machine**! The flush cycle rinses the brew group (where the grounds land) and you waste that coffee.

**Foam milk without coffee**: Select Latte Macchiato, then hold the Coffee Strength button for 3 seconds to select pre-ground coffee so you don’t grind any beans, then start the machine. Once you have your froth/foam, press the STOP button to stop the brew cycle.

**If your travel mug is too tall to fit**, make one or two coffees (or a latte macchiato and a coffee) in a regular cup and pour it into the travel cup.",1610591775

Harken has a few staples as well as a few rotating special selections, all of which have been exceptionally delicious. 

Prototype is on a whole other level with their selection, I have yet to be disappointed with anything they've touched. Beans seem to have a higher tolerance for the hotter brews for all of you that brew right off boil!

Coffee,aiherrera97,kwu04n,Fellow Stagg issues ?,"Hey! So I just got my Stagg kettle and I read through the instructions but I’m noticing and things going on with mine that I haven’t heard in review videos or blogs. 

1) when I set the temperature to 203 degrees it doesn’t ever stay on 203. It bounces from 205 down to 202. Yes I understand it should do this when like settling on 203 but I’ve turned it on, set it, and have walked away to see if it will land on 203 and stay there after some time. It does not. It just keeps bouncing between temperatures. 

2) besides the bouncing and not setting on the temperature I desire, it’ll go way past. So I have a picture of setting it to 117 and instead of stopping (or bouncing around it) it keeps going to like 127! 

3) this isn’t as important but it’s driving me insane. I have been playing the wormy game and have noticed that I’ll click over to move right or left and the knob clicks but the worm doesn’t move. It’ll be four or five clicks in and the worm doesn’t move. I know this sounds really stupid but I don’t understand how people are getting their ridiculous times when half the time my knob isn’t registering when I click it over. 

It’s hard for me to believe that any of this is normal for one of the most expensive and favored kettle on the market. Is it normal? Am I insane for expecting this kettle to sit on a temperature that I adjusted it to?",1610583874

Coffee,Andrew12Dance,kwovjz,There is a particular roasted property I can’t understand...,"I’m probably not nearly as hard core as many on this sub, so could really use your knowledge/help in figuring this out!!

Last year in NYC, my girlfriend (longtime coffee drinker/aficionado) and I would frequently go to a neighborhood Italian restaurant, where their coffee was unlike anything we’d ever had. It had this nutty roastedness/sweetness that was completely unique. The thing is, it was a pretty standard Lavazza. What’s more, it was highly inconsistent each time we went, until our regular server realized that it was only when the coffee was at the very bottom of the pot that it had this unique property (we would actually call in before coming, so important to us it became and so good was it!)

Anyway, we bought the same exact Lavazza for our home and nothing, no reproduction of that flavor. Other attempts to get that taste (Illy at Italian places, various espressos, general coffee drinking since, etc.) have yielded nothing. We got a Nespresso and while we’ve been enjoying it, absolutely no blend/variety has this.

So we chalked it up to a fluke, some quirk of chemistry that would be achieved again... who knows when?

But then this happened, and it blew our mind: on a short vacation we needed some quick, easy coffee and picked this up at a local grocery store:

https://www.target.com/p/starbucks-subtly-sweet-medium-roast-coffee-48-fl-oz/-/A-78295046

Mind you, neither of us like Starbucks all that much but again, it was a quick purchase and we figured it would be fine.

OH MY GOD. It was perfect, and it recreated the same experience as that Italian restaurant. *Something* about this particular product gives it that exact same roast flavor. We are enamored with it now. The thing is though, again, we don’t even like Starbucks traditionally and I can certainly attest that nothing we’ve ever drunk there even comes close to this.

So what do you all think? (Maybe even one of you would be willing to go try this (?)) We would love to determine what this property is so that we can obtain it more regularly, possibly even intensify it/find even better examples out there. It’s basically like we just discovered some spice and now want to know which cuisines use it in spades! :)

Over the months I've picked up a lot of new gear, beans, and skills that really helped me improve the quality of my brew. I'm a teacher, so at this point my bloodstream is probably 80% coffee. I actually got sick with COVID a few weeks ago and completely lost my sense of smell. It was absolutely miserable and coffee became completely flat and bitter. I couldn't get any complex notes of flavor, aroma, or anything. It was horrible. My sense of smell has gradually come back and I think I'm finally back this morning. I made my cup like I always do. #17 on my Barraza grinder, using my V60. I just bought myself a new kettle that allows me to get the perfect temperature on my water. I tried to be really deliberate with the pour and count out the time as well. When I finished brewing and took a sip, I was completely blown away by the flavor and aroma of the coffee I had just made. I always thought those tasting notes were a bit of bullshit, but this time  I really tasted the dark chocolate and cherry notes. It's something I've been thinking about since this morning. I don't know when I'll be able to create another cup that good, but I hope to try again later and see if I can come close.

Coffee,Barisaxgod,kwlo5u,Some little bits of coffee advice that I haven't seen discussed much.,"Over time, I've picked up some little tidbits of knowledge through experimentation, and some of them don't seem to be discussed much. Here are a few little tips that some people light find useful.

* A lens blower is a fantastic tool for cleaning your grinder. It's the best way to clean out a grounds chute or burr chamber, but a toothbrush is still better for the burrs themselves.
* The first sip of a well-mixed espresso will have the worst taste but the best texture. This is due to crema. Crema tastes more bitter and less sweet than the rest of the espresso (crema-lovers need not reply), but it also has great texture (because foam), and if the strength of your espresso is homogenous because you stirred it, that will give the perception of more texture and more bitterness in the first sip of an espresso. For this reason, I would recommend skimming the crema off of your espressos when you are dialing in, when you typically only take one sip of an espresso.
* Never buy natural processed coffees from wet or cool regions (i.e. Guatemala, Sumatra). A lot of sun and heat is needed for a successful natural process (which is why it's relatively popular in parts of Africa), and naturals from cool or wet regions tend to stray on the side of barnyard as opposed to fruity and jammy. I can't fathom why roasters still sometimes sell naturals from cool/wet regions. I'm sure there are some good ones, but I haven't come across one yet. Locations of these wet/cool regions can be weird too, because while Guatemala is usually cool and wet, neighboring El Salvador is far hotter and drier on average, and produces some very good naturals.
* In filter coffee, I often find it easier to diagnose underextraction by looking for a lack of sweetness and texture than by looking for tons of sourness. I'll occasionally recalibrate my reference for underextraction by brewing a v60 with way too coarse of a grind size, and more often than not, the lack of sweetness and texture is more obvious than an increase of acidity. There is an increase in perceived acidity in underextracted coffee compared to well-extracted coffee, but it's not so obvious as to be the first thing I look for.

I hope at least a few people find this helpful, thanks for reading to the end, and have an excellent day.",1610560019

Coffee,Vicosku,kwki42,Roast Level Perspective from 1975 Book,"I found an old book titled, ""[The Book of Coffee &amp; Tea](https://imgur.com/JPIbhU5)"" written in 1975. Within, the American preference for lighter-roasted coffees is described. I find it interesting to read the perspective of a time before Starbucks swept the nation, nearly 50 years ago. I thought you might as well. Specifically, this line makes me grin:

""A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.""

Here are links to photos of the pages, and the transcribed text:

[The Variety of Roasts](https://imgur.com/hsEfhPB)

The roasting of coffee turns the beans brown; the longer they're roasted, the darker they get. Coffee roasted too light won't have much of a coffee taste at all. Coffee can also be roasted so dark that it tastes burnt. Between these two extremes are a variety of roasts all tasting like coffee, each appealing to particular tastes.

Simply put, the darker coffee is roasted, the darker it tastes. Is any one roast the optimum? No, just as it would be silly to say that steak should only be broiled ""medium."" Is dark-roasted coffee stronger? No. It is common to credit dark-roasted coffee with producing a very, very strong beverage, but this is not accurate. It would be best to say that dark-roasted coffee has a characteristic ""dark-roasted"" taste, even if that may seem to be begging the question. The strength of coffee is directly dependent on the amount of soluble solids in the brew, that is, the solution of coffee in water. If coffee is ""strong"" it should be because more coffee is used, resulting in a stronger solution, not because of the roast itself. Espresso is in fact usually brewed with twice the amount of coffee normally recommended.

Not only does coffee get darker in color the longer it is roasted, but it also loses more weight and swells more in size. Oils held within the beans of a lighter roast are driven to the surface in a dark roast. Dark-roasted beans appear shiny. They have very slightly less caffeine and are somewhat less acidic than light-roasted beans. They are slightly more susceptible to becoming stale because surface waxes that remain intact on light-roasted beans are destroyed by more prolonged heating. The characteristic dark roasted flavor tends to overshadow the more subtle flavors produced by lighter roasting. Some of the more delicate flavor oils and aromatics are in fact destroyed by dark roasting. What dark-roasted coffee may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up for in force. A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.

[Detailed Roast Levels](https://imgur.com/CMFrZsX)

Light city roast: In sections of the West, this is the standard. The bean is not fully developed, the color more cinnamon-like than brown, the flavor thin.

City roast: The most widely used style in this country. Also called brown roast or American roast, it is the preference of most consumers here. This roast yields a beverage that may lack brilliance and come up on the flat side.

Full city roast: Favored by some regional roasters in cosmopolitan centers, particularly New York City. Slightly longer roasted, the bean is dark brown, shows no oil on the surface, and gives a deeper heartier cup. The American roasts of specialty shops are likely to be full city rather than city.

Brazilian: Don't confuse this with the name given to coffee grown in Brazil. Just darker than full city, this roast has the faintest hint of dark roast flavor. A trace of oil shows on the bean.

Viennese roast: There seems to be the least consensus on what this roast is, probably because there are many variations, even in Vienna. It falls midway between full city and French roasts. Mix half and half of these two roasts.

French roast (New Orleans roast): With this roast oiliness is quite apparent on the bean's surface and the color is burnt umber, the color of semi sweet chocolate. The flavor is remarkably different from any of the lighter roasts. It approaches Espresso flavor but remains smooth. It is French roasted coffee to which chicory is added for Louisiana style coffee. Two commercially prepared examples of this coffee/chicory mixture are Luzianne and French Market.

Spanish/Cuban/French-Italian roast: Darker than French but not quite Italian, this coffee is great for those who want Espresso without the bite. Mix French and Italian roasts, if this happy medium is not available, and you'll get very close to the flavor. Commercially prepared versions of this roast are Bustelo and El Pico. Some A&amp;P stores have coffee in this roast in the bean.

Italian/ Espresso roast: This roast is the highest, heaviest, darkest. Almost to carbonization. The bean surface is shiny and oily, the color black, the flavor Italian. Medaglia D'Oro is a commercially prepared example of this roast.

Coffee,sentientrip,kwkcqj,"Been manual brewing since last October, some tips","It took me a while to dial in my tastes (I brew exclusively with V60 and Aeropress, 1-2 cups) and there are a few things which really helped me along the way. At first, the coffee was just not coming out very good at all (bitter, intense, severe) and it took me a lot of trial and error to get to a consistent point.

\- Invest in a temperature controlled kettle. This helps you keep another variable constant as you dial in your taste. Obviously you should already have a nice burr grinder which is the first biggest investment. I pretty much stick with 96C for all my light roasts.

\- Google image search coffee grind size. This one had the largest impact on taste for me. I thought I was grinding medium-fine but it was closer to fine, and in the end I actually moved to more of a medium grind for both my V60 and Aeropress. It also depends on the coffee bean, strangely enough. For one light roast I was sitting at 22 on the Baratza Encore, but for a different light roast that was coming out harsh and i moved towards 24 (this confused me because I saw a lot of other people using around 15-16 grind setting, but when i compared my grind size to images online i found it was much too fine on my machine. So not all sizes are universal, i guess. It took me a LONG time to figure this out, because going from 15-16 to 18 wasn't giving me much of a difference). 

\- If you are buying your beans at a local coffee shop, ask them to do a pour over for you of the coffee you are buying. This helped me a lot because i was able to compare and constrast with how i was brewing. I actually prefer my brew method now compared to how they brewed because i like to brew a smoother cup, but i have a jumping off point for how it should taste.

\- Stick to the same recipe so you again are keeping variables as constant as possible, and just messing with one at a time.

\- Brew small batches (15g, etc) and more times in a day so you can play around with the recipe, and then move towards a larger brew once you dial it in. Some days i would do 3-4 brews lol, its fun!

&amp;#x200B;

Now i get the subtle hints in the taste once i dialed it in, for example i am doing this El Salvador brew right now which has hints of honey in it, very nice! I shared some of my coffee with neighbor and family and they said i ruined their coffee for them, they tasted no bitterness, said it was the smoothest cup they have had and now having trouble going back to their bitter coffee!

Columbian from Coffee Exchange Providence

I started by watching some YouTube videos primarily this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0g8umpINGQ&amp;feature=youtu.be

So here how I understand it is 18g dose, 2:1 extraction with a final espresso yield of 36g over 25-30secs. 

First problem: I started on a grind setting of 6 following exactly what the video does it. What I've realized is especially with the Sagada Dark roast 18g does not even some close to fitting in the portafilter, the Columbian it's way below. How worried should I be about dose vs the spacing? I'm using the standard tamper which I know isn't consistent but it just doesn't seem right. 


The biggest problem: I set it to program and time out how long it takes to get to 36g. On a grind setting of 6 no matter what it always seems to be around 8-12secs. Even on the finest of settings no matter the coffee, no matter how much I tamper it, no matter how much I change I am NO WHERE clue to 25-30secs. The pressure gauge is in the ""espresso range,"" the dose is around 18g, the crema looks good, but the time is literally off by over half.

I've been practicing a few times a day for a couple of months now so I'm confident that I'm following the steps properly. The comments in the video suggest that the 500ml of water he uses should result in around a 3:30 total brew time. Then at lower volumes the time should redcue, e.g. 2:30 for 250ml.

Here is all of the information related to my brew:

Filter: Bleached Hario V60 02 (made in Austria)

Coffee,motoridersd,kwispg,Mocccamaster and Breville Smart Grinder Pro - Looking for pointers,"Hello! I've spent some time on this sub trying to improve my at home brewing over the past year. One of the best changes I made thanks to reading was using proper mineralized water over our very heavy tap water (San Diego). 

Our morning pots have improved a lot since then. Also moved to better local beans (Dark Horse Coffee). We like medium to light roasts, we drink it black and enjoy finding the notes of the beans. 

Equipment:

* Moccamaster with Manual Basket
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro. Usually use the lowest end of the Drip setting, but lately have been trying going coarser
* Third Water water
* 0.01 gram precision scale
* Melitta #4 white filters
* Ratio is 1000 ml water (not usually weighed though, using brewer tank markings) and 62g coffee

Lately I've been feeling like our coffee hasn't been the best it can be. I've played around with grind sizes and Moccamaster techniques, and I feel like lately nothing I do seems to get me to the sweet spot. Especially when comparing my version of the brew to a drip coffee of the same beans from the local shop.

The Moccamaster technique I use is rinsing the paper filter with 200 ml water, adding grounds and locking basket, stirring grounds and opening basket full way. Stirring halfway through (at about 500 ml), then tapping basket once water tank is empty. I've tried letting the grounds bloom by turning off the coffee maker, but I haven't been very consistent with this.

I've been using a spreadsheet to track grind size setting, water and coffee amount, and notes about the brewing technique as well as rating each brew. 

So, I think at this point my issue is the Breville grinder. When I first got it, I read a lot of people saying it wasn't the best for drip, as it was better suited for espresso. Back then I liked the idea of having a hopper to hold the beans and a programmable timer to determine how much coffee to use. I no longer use either of those features so it has become a decoration that is used in a very manual way.

I've tried using the Coffee Compass to dial in the brews, but I must admit I am not very good at determining exactly where I am, if it's under or over extracted. I just know it's not as good. Sometimes it's too bitter, sometimes it's a bit ""vegetal"" (I think).

One thing I've noticed with the beans I get, is that there are a lot of lighter colored grinds, that look like shavings, at the top of the ground beans. Are these the fines that I read about? Are these bad/unwanted and an indicator of an issue with the grinder or its configuration? Will these produce unwanted flavor profiles?

One metric I am not very clear on is, how much time should 1000 ml of water take to brew on the Moccamaster. I see between 4 to 6 minutes. I start counting as soon as the water hits the grounds, but do I turn off the basket when the flow becomes a drip? How long do I wait before shutting off the basket and stopping the counter.

This morning I went coarser than usual, and counted about 5 minutes from water hitting the grounds to all the water in the basket being below the grounds and the flow becoming a drip. Used La Colombe Mexico Sierra Sur (sometimes we buy these if we're in UTC) and even though I got one of the notes when smelling it (rose), the coffee tastes a bit salty/sour/vegetal (I think). So that would tell me I went too coarse on the grounds. Yesterday, with a finer grind than today, it was a bit bitter

Anyway, any tips would be highly appreciated as I must be missing something.",1610552110

The first week or so I managed to brew wonderful coffee. The coffee bed was flat after each brew and the coffee tasted evenly extracted, clear and sweet. Then I wanted to experiment a bit and started messing with water temperatures and grind sizes. The coffee got gradually worse and I struggled to get a flat grounds bed even when I tried. I always ended up with a dome in the middle of the grounds. Yesterday I hit the rock bottom and brewed so over-extracted and astrigent coffee that I couldn’t drink it. Today I tried to go back to the same water temperature and grind setting I had last time I brewed a great cup - to no avail. The coffee was better than yesterday, yet still bitter or sour.

What troubles me the most, is that I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong or differently from what I did at the beginning, when the coffee was still good. I’m using Wilfa Uniform grinder and the last great cup of coffee was with grind setting 24. Water temperatures I’ve used have all been within 94-97 celsius range for medium roasted coffee. The drawdowns have been 2:50-3:30 minutes. I’m using 30g of coffee to 500g of water. The coffee itself is good and of great quality.

Coffee,the_commissaire,kwf0xk,[Gear] Grinder recommendations - for multiple grind settings,"Hi everyone.

I am a fan of using lots of different ways of making coffee. Some days cafetiere, some days espresso, some days mokka, pour over... 

Right now I have a hand grinder for espresso &amp; pour over and then just get the place I get my coffee from to grind it for me in a reasonable ""general purpose"" setting for the other methods.

**Does anyone know of a product on the market (new or used) that sort of lets me change the grind setting and quantity on the fly?**

I am not too fussed about whether it has a large hopper or if you have the weight the beans and fill it up for each grind. I am also kind of willing to sacrifice a bit of grind quality for the functionality (after all its just has to be better than using pre-ground). 

I am fairly flexible on budget. But ideally less than £200 (~270usd, ~230eur)... but I am interested to hear whats on the market at a higher price point if its gong to be worth it; if it can be had for even cheaper then I am all ears.

Coffee,imkylebell,krc5vh,Good coffee from a vintage siphon pot,"Maybe two or three years ago after returning from Japan, I decided I wanted to try replicating the siphon coffee that we were served for our first breakfast. I some research and found out that they used to be very common in the US before auto-percolators took off in the 1960s. I then bought a Nicro Model 500 off Craigslist with the metal filter, figuring it would be less prone to breakage than glass and easier to clean than a cloth filter.

The problem is, I could never make good coffee. The water wouldn't heat up to the suggested 205 degrees and it would clog instead of draining. 

Then, this past week, I tried it again and it made excellent coffee. It was complex, deep, clean, and even warmer at first sip than a pour-over. I used:

* a light generic breakfast roast
* a 17.5:1 ratio
* a grind size similar to pre-ground drip coffee
* 900g of water, enough for three mugs of coffee
* no temperature measurement, only turning down stove and waiting for water to stop bubbling in the upper chamber
* coffee steeping for around a minute, then turned off gas and let coffee drain

Full brew time was somewhere from 5-7 minutes. 

I started thinking how I might have lucked into such a good cup and I realized that a big batch, high ratio, drip grind generic coffee, and no temp control is probably how the device was meant to be used in a 1950s kitchen or diner, where there wouldn't have been fancy grinders, temp probes, or even time to fuss over the coffee like I would with a manual pour-over.

Coffee,brono_trigger,kr8bal,Do you wash your coffee pot/carafe with soap and water?,"I was at my mom's for the holidays and as I was about to wash the coffee pot with soap and water, as one does, she exclaimed in horror ""No! Never wash it with soap, just rinse it with hot water!"". When I asked her why, she couldn't give me a reason other than that's what she was always told.  So I gave her a suspicious side-eye, but begrudgingly went along with it and drank coffee out of a pot with brown stains all around the insides of it, because she's at the age where you can't tell her what she's always known is wrong.  

It's not the first time I've had someone tell me they don't use soap on their coffee pots... back when I was too young too know better than to drink the office coffee, a co-worker also told me they don't use soap because it leaves residue that affects the flavor of the coffee.  I was suspicious then as well, since if he believed hot water was hot enough to get rid of the residual coffee oils (which it's not) why wouldn't it also be able to get rid of the soap residue?  He also told me his theory applied to wine glasses as well and I almost fainted.  

I feel like this is a myth that needs to die.  Coffee flavors come from the oil in the beans right? Oil exposed to air goes rancid over time.  Oil and water don't mix, so hot water is not enough to completely get rid of residual coffee oils (otherwise we wouldn't need soap to clean greasy pans!).  Rancid oil residues in your fresh pot of coffee will make it taste not as good as it should, thus the logical conclusion would be that if you really don't want the flavor of your coffee being affected by any foreign substances, you need to wash you coffee pots (and filter baskets) with soap and water.

With that said, I do agree that some brands of dish soap (like Palmolive and Dawn, and pretty much any dishwasher detergent) don't rinse clean unless you rinse them very very well, which I didn't realize until I started wondering why my glass of water always had a thin layer of bubbles at the top (hint, they weren't air bubbles).  But I've found that using a soap made with more ""natural"" ingredients (like Mrs Meyers or Trader Joes) rinses away very quickly and leaves no discernible residue.

I think I may have just answered my own question, but still wondering what others' thoughts are on soap in your coffee pot.  I get taking the hot water rinsing shortcut a few days in a row, and I definitely have been guilty of it, but I don't understand being adamant about NEVER using soap for fear it's going to run your coffee.",1609882197

I am looking for recommendations for a “single cup” auto drip brewer to replace my trusty, albeit lackluster Hamilton Beach Scoop. “Single cup” is in quotes because many in that category are just a touch too small.

My concerns and needs are these:

1) I am the only coffee drinker in the house and generally have one 14-16 ounce coffee each morning. Rarely a second. Also, the battle for counter space is real in my house. It needs to be small.

2) I hate cleanup. Fewer parts is better. Brewing directly into the mug is best! I was eyeballing the Bonavita, but the basket-on-carafe design means using and cleaning the carafe every time. No thanks.

3) This will not replace my Aeropress, French press, etc. I will spend the time when I have it, but most days I need the coffee to take care of itself while I spend time feeding my two preschool-aged kids.

4) I have begun roasting my own as a hobby, but I rarely have time for cupping. Having an auto drip that lets me taste my coffee the best it can be in my daily cup is very helpful.

Coffee,tauhammerhead,kr7nae,Aeropress v Stovetop,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 people’s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought I’d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: I’m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isn’t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear people’s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609880337

For example when I see James Hoffman videos and he goes like 500gr of water and 30gr of coffee that's too much just for me, so I scale it down to about 200gr of water and 12gr of coffee but I use the same brew time (that's about 3 minutes for the v60) but coffee taste... bad... like weird, I don't know if is over extracting or what (I keep the same grindsize as i'd doo for 500gr of water)  but I cant tell as Im not 100% sure i can recognize over-extracted coffee.

So, if i cut amounts in half, should i also cut times in half?",1609878031

Coffee,BackStageChief,kr6e88,Picking up/squeezing v60 filter??,"Just a quick post, looking for other people's opinions. So today I went into our local Cafe and decided to try a new pour over Guatemala roast. I was able to see what their barista was doing, and everything seemed normal until the end. After pouring she waited until the cone drained maybe half way, then pinched the top together and kind of moved the filter in a circle around the cone. In my experience with pour over you simply wait for your filter to drain and throw it away. The way I see it is you're applying pressure, AND squeezing those last few drops from the grounds, which just sounds like a recipe for bitter over extracted coffee. It's not like it was bad or anything, but I like getting the max potential out of my beans. What do y'all think? Ever apply pressure at the end of your brew? Why? Why not? How did it taste?

I actually think a Peets coffee that they brew at the Peets coffee shop, while having a lot of flavor is too strong for me, so I don't mind that Gaggia output is weaker, but using Peets beans purchased at a grocery gives a much much weaker cup from the machine.

Coffee,gotfondue,kr5yp7,Kyoto Slow Drip - first time,"Finally started my kyoto cold drip instead of buying a cup every morning and sometimes not because they ran out or just had to start my day before they opened. So my wife got me a Yama Slow drip for xmas. 

I was not expecting to pick up the process so fast and get my first full batch out by 11PM that night. I had a few hiccups with stopping the drip, and the grinds becoming saturated and not dripping through. That was solved by my next batch with a more coarse grind. Currently just finished my first bag of Stumptown coffee - it was exactly the same taste that I was getting from the local shop so I am pleasantly surprised I got that right.

My next batch I am going to use pH balanced water and try to make sure I use the coldest water possible. Any suggestions on how to keep the water cold, I do add ice but that just increases the water in the tank and more water out. I was thinking of doing an ice bath around the beaker that holds the grounds, custom Tupperware setup and keep adding ice to that instead of the water tank itself.

Also this is my first time brewing coffee (minus the pre-ground coffee at the office).

Coffee,FunWind,kr4xu7,moka pot w/ electric coil range,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster here

I use my Moka pot on an electric coil range (not induction) and wanted to describe my method that is giving me good results.

- As the range takes some time to heat up, my first step is to set the smallest element on high before I do anything else.

- Next I fill the bottom with cold water as I don't feel like boiling a kettle.  Add coffee and screw Moka together.

- put the Moka on the corner of the coils, so the base has the most coverage.

- As soon as I notice the water start to make some pre-boiling noise, I cut the heat from max -&gt; ""5"" (medium).

- once the coffee starts to erupt I kill the heat entirely, letting the residual heat take it to completion.


As the heat output of these electric ranges take some time to adjust to the setting, I've found this to be a good balance between speed / quality / simplicity

If the coffee eruption starts and heat is too high I've found that it bubbles quickly, and the flow is interrupted prematurely, leading to incomplete extraction.  I started to time things, but if you pay attention you can hear the water talking to you, telling you it is close. :)

Protip: If you miss it and the coffee is flowing quickly, you can lift the Moka pot above the element, this will decrease heat very quickly.

Lastly I don't think there is a more satisfying moment than the noise she makes just as she's about to erupt, hearing it grow and build until it slowly trickles down.  😎",1609872825

Coffee,SomebodyInACity,kqxk9g,I never knew that a grinder upgrade would make such a dramatic impact!,"Hello hello!

Reminder that having good tools helps a ton. I recently upgraded to a commandante c40, coming from a hario slim, and holy moly was it worth it. Along with that I got a pouring kettle, and that's been great cuz I like preboiling my water before i put it in my bialetti. I'll do a before and after coffee routine so you can have a good laugh at how ridiculously complex things used to be.

Before, to get a mediocre cup of moka, I had to:  
1. Guesstimate the amount of coffee beans, put it in grinder  
2. spend 20 minutes grinding, with the grinder frequently jamming  
3. sift the grounds into a big bowl  
4. grind the left over giant grinds through again  
5. sift that once more, throw away whats left  
6. spread out grounds on paper towel, massage it around to catch the fines  
7. collect grounds in a smaller bowl, throw away the paper towel  
8. Spoon coffee into bialetti basket carefully  
9. put bowl with water into a microwave to boil it, put hotplate on induction hob  
10. spoon boiled water from boil into base, put in coffee basket, screw on the top.  
11. finally place moka pot on hotplate and let it do its thing  
12. cool down base before the fountain starts sputtering and FINALLY get to drink coffee

And even then with all that effort, all I got was a ton of unbalanced extraction. I couldn't get rid of this ""battery acid"" taste that seemed to get into everything i did, and changing grind size on the hario slim never did anything to mitigate it.  
Now, it's so simple, it's laughable.  
1. Weigh out coffee beans on scale  
2. grind in under a minute  
3. flip the grounds into the basket, the commandante jars fit the basket perfectly  
4. Boil water in kettle, heat up induction hotplate  
5. put boiling water in moka, put in coffee basket, screw on the top  
6. moka on hotplate, let it do it's thing  
7. cool down base before fountain starts sputtering and have coffee!

I haven't dialled things in exactly, but the difference in grind quality means that the resulting coffee i've been getting is so much less muddy. A good grinder really goes a long way. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to notice anything, but even just in smell the difference was clear as day. The battery acid taste, gone. The siltiness of the coffee was a lot less, there wasn't as much sand that came up. Thank you guys for guiding me into getting a better grinder, it's brought me a LOT of joy and confidence to keep experimenting.",1609849747

I was gifted a Stagg stovetop kettle and a Tesla Mug to add to my coffee gear for Christmas, and was quite excited especially for the kettle since I’ve been using a basic Amazon gooseneck kettle up until now. 

But after my first few cups my coffee started tasting incredibly bland and vegetal (think major under extraction). With all my coffees starting to taste bland I actually went and got tested for Covid thinking I might have subtle symptoms of loss of taste. 

One negative test later and a couple weeks of testing, I was able to confirm that the kettle and my mug were making my coffee taste less flavorful. I brewed a number of V60s side by side (new kettle, old kettle, new mug, old mug) and was able to absolutely taste major differences.

Coffee,piage84,kqqwlw,Breville Infuser - pressure question,"Hi guys, 

I bought a Breville Infuser. I don't grind my own coffee ass I don't have a grinder but I'm getting the coffee from a local roaster (250g) and they grind it for me in the spot and put it in a sealed bag with valve.

I've been making few coffee and I noticed that, even if I put just 14g of coffee and i don't temper much, the pressure gauge jumps above the ""correct"" area. No matter how hard or soft I press. If I press normally, the flow is really poor. I believe it's because the coffee is too fine.

How would I explain this to the roaster? Just by saying make it coarser than the usual espresso grind? Do I have to specify a setting?",1609822278

I tend to prefer very strong brews of coffee, but recently out of politeness to my coworkers, I've been brewing coffee in a French press, and making it less like the grimace-inducing rocket fuel I prefer, which got me thinking.

Here's the question: I've noticed that brewing with too much water (or not enough grounds) results in a cup of coffee that tastes weak, unpleasant, and generally dissatisfying. 

However, brewing stronger coffee and adding hot water, a la Americanos, seems to result in a better-tasting cup, even if the water-to-grounds ratio approaches that of the weak pot of coffee mentioned above.

Coffee,andrei-dreamwhale,l6b601,"Specialty Coffee scene in Lisbon &amp; Porto, Portugal","Hey guys,

Based on brief browsing I've noticed that the subject had been popping up, but never properly developed, so I thought it's worth giving it a shot again.

Despite strong scepticism, specialty coffee scene that was believed to be obsolete, has not only survived but kept evolving and growing stronger. Although it still is a miserably small share of the market in comparison with local commercial leather-n-coal robusta dealers, some things started happening: 2 Aeropress Competitions, a Coffee Festival where specialty roasters were given a ground next to big players, chain specialty coffeeshops, an actual stable coffee community, and 2 completely different coffee capitals - turf-obsessed Lisbon and welcoming laid-back Porto.

To kickstart the thread I'll just go with my Lisbon favorites:

* [Roastberry Coffee Lab](https://roastberry.pt/en/product-category/shop/cafe/) \- reliable roasting consistency, Q-grader on board, great bean selection, got their CoE El Salvador - was a tropical banger, also had another gem from El Salvador - natural SL28.
* Olisipo - know them personally, a sweet team of two. Great roast, good converstions, impressive selection.
* Wow Coffee Roasters - a tad cringy name hides awfully good bean selection.
* Brava, Sgt Martinho, Academia de Cafe, Fabrica, etc.

And those would be just the roasting companies - there are dozens of new specialty/3rd wave coffeeshops that have opened over last 3 years representing either the local or european roasters.

Things are happening and it would be cool to see what you guys think. Cheers!",1611772148

I’ve had a Bonavita BV-1800-TH for 6 years now and it’s a great machine - usually. Every 2-4 months or so it decides to overflow and make coffee all over my kitchen. Over the years, I’ve discovered many “solutions” to this issue: less water, less coffee, carefully filling the basket ensuring no grounds get under the filter cone, different brands of coffee, different grinds (currently 22 on the Baratza Encore grinder)... my theory is the coffee is blooming up in the basket and floating up and over the paper filter then clogging the basket hole. Thinking it was the excessive bloom of freshly ground coffee, I’ve taken to pre-grinding a week or so of coffee and storing that in an airtight container. This appeared to work for a while, but, like all my solutions, it always ends in a counter full of coffee and grounds.

The only foolproof safe method for me is to stop the machine about halfway through its cycle, wait a few minutes, then continue. Of course, I am very lazy and would prefer not to babysit the machine every brew.

Is this a known issue with this machine? Are there other quality drip machines that deal with bloom better?

     I have recently acquired a V60 2 cup brewer. I have had hit or miss brews with the brewer. Now I know that it's entirely user error because I know it can make great coffee. My problem is that I can't seem to nail a great grind size for it.

When I see a tutorial video on YouTube, someone like James Hoffmann who I know, knows what he's doing. His grind size is larger than mine. I know that because I can see larger pieces that look far coarser than my much fluffier looking grind.

I know that the brew should be somewhere around 3:30-4:00 mins for a brew. The best I seem to be able to do is just over 3mins long. And I'm grinding rather fine, I'm trying to pour as gently as possible but still providing enough water to sufficiently keep water in the brewer, covering the coffee. The brews are usually just over 3 mins and are almost always underextrcted and weak.

I aim for a 20g to 280ml brew. Though I've try anywhere from 18-22g to try and change the extraction ratio. But it still seems to have little effect.

What are your recommendations and thoughts on how I can improve my brews? Any recommendation is appreciated, I'm by no means set in my ways of using the brewer.

Thank you!",1611622322

At this point I have a distribution technique down where I kind of shake/tap the portafilter to settle the grounds evenly, use a distribution tool, and then tamp.

So, now it's time to step up to a proper burr grinder. I will continue to use my moka pot and may end up buying an entry-level espresso machine later on.

I wanted to keep the costs low but things snowballed and I eventually settled on parting with $360 CAD for a Baratza Sette 30. A quick search on camelcamelcamel reveals that the price of this grinder remains quite steady, so I don't expect a sale on it anytime soon.

Just as I was about to buy it, I saw an ad for the Breville Smart Grinder Pro, now discounted to $240 CAD. I'm familiar with the Breville from reviews I've watched and considered it as well, but I preferred the look and performance of the Sette 30.

I got the Barista Express about 2 years ago to save money on coffee shop flat whites (it backfired 😂), but soon side stepped milk drinks and have been making filter coffee with a commandante for about 18 months. I use chemically ideal water, know about extraction principles, buy nice high-grown beans and like to nerd out on the pour-overs.

However, I’ve just got a Niche Zero this week, and now I’ve got a perfectly good, stepless espresso grinder, I’ve been thinking about getting into speciality espresso for the first time.

Or would I be best off spending some more money on a better machine?

Coffee,P4ULUS,l4xqxw,Moccamaster vs Drip: My Experience,"Background:

I’ve been preparing single cup pour over coffee for years as I prefer the pure taste of pour over to machine brewing methods. Recently, I splurged on a Moccamaster as I thought a machine would save time in preparing coffee each morning for my partner and I as stirring and pouring the drip is time consuming. We consume about three 6-8 ounce cups total between us each day.

Moccamaster Review:

This is a nice coffee maker. Don't get me wrong. Moccamaster makes good coffee and produces said coffee quite quickly once loaded up so make no mistake about that. However, I will be returning my Moccamaster and reverting back to pour over methods. Here's why:

1) Cheap plastic parts and design shortcomings. As others have mentioned, many of the Technivorm pieces are flimsy plastic afterthoughts that don't give using this machine a high-end feel. The funnel cover and hot water dripper can be easily knocked out of place and the pot itself scrapes the heating plate when put beneath the dripper. It gets annoying needing to be so careful to collect the parts properly and not break or displace anything. 
2) Water basin is not removable. As far as cleaning goes, it's not straightforward as the water basin is screwed in. I understand the thinking here - it's only purified water that goes in there so why clean it? Would be better if this was removable.
3) Inefficiency. Probably the biggest issue for us. With the Moccamaster versus a pourover, I found we needed 7-8 double tablespoon scoops (~16 tablespoons) for 2-3 cups of coffee vs 12 tablespoons using a Chemex pour over for the same number of cups. I was using way more coffee with the moccamaster compared with pourover methods as the drip method is simply not as efficient. This issue is not unique to the moccamaster but there are likely smarter machines at saturating the grounds. 
4) The two-setting hot plate functionality is problematic because it's always on when the coffee maker is on meaning the coffee is constantly heating up in the pot while the funnel is still dripping. When making a bigger pot (8+ cups), the coffee ends up tasting overheated.
5) No timer. A $300 coffee makers should have a timer or at least more features than simply dripping hot water over coffee beans. 

Results:
For me, the best solution I’ve found is a Chemex. A large pour over apparatus provides some added efficiency versus a single cup pour over while retaining the same great taste and overall process control. We bought a Chemex and will continue with pour over.

Interested to hear others thoughts and experiences with expensive coffee machines vs pour over. For us, we simply didn’t find the time savings that we’d hoped for. Thanks!",1611609298

I know people have reasons for brewing into a carafe- multiple servings, temperature considerations, anesthetic, etc. I brew for one and like brewing into my mug. I mix with a spoon as soon as the brew is finished, so no issue with that. I can also swirl a mug if I want to. (I've just ordered a glass mug so I can see the process better). Nothing about using a mug bothers me. I don't want to purchase a new carafe to clean after every brew, if it's not going to improve my pourover

I just got a BBE and am enjoying it so far. I started with the non-pressurized basket to explore a bit, but after doing what I thought was exactly the same thing twice, and having two drastically different shots come out, I decided to go to the pressurized basket and see the difference. I'm liking it, it irons out all of my flaws and it seemingly doesn't matter what I do... They all taste pretty good.

The one issue I have with the pressurized basket is that the puck is so stuck in there I can't bang it out and have to use a spoon to get it out. This never happened with the shots I used the non-pressurized basket on. I tried putting a lot less ground coffee in to the basket, thinking this might be the problem, but no, its just a much wetter puck that is still super stuck in there. Is this a common thing with pressurized baskets, and what can I do to fix this? Or should I just get used to spooning it out of the basket?

Thanks",1611582465
Coffee,JSmurfington,l4nr25,How much coffee do you typically waste dialing in a bag for espresso?,"It pains me how much I waste trying to dial in. Sometimes I'm lucky and it only takes a cup or two wasted. Other times, it's 3-4 cups. Plus now I upgraded to an electric grinder from a manual grinder and apparently I'm only supposed to adjust the grind finer while it's running. So that can be another cup or so wasted.

Coffee,Lognipo,kz7foe,Grind size vs quantity,"Good morning!

Someone was kind enough to get me the Baratza Encore I wanted for Christmas, and now that I have some control over my grind size, I was wondering how to use this to my advantage.

I love to drink coffee over long periods, but I am fairly caffeine sensitive, and alas, this year I seem to have also developed a tendency for heartburn related to coffee.  As much as I like the bolder flavors of coffee, I need to brew it weaker than I used to.  So with a blade grinder, and also so far with the Encore, I have been brewing about 8 cups to 3 very slightly heaped tablespoons, and this allows me to drink the entire pot with no caffeine issues and no heartburn.

That said, if I want to play around with adjusting the strength of the coffee, would I be better off adjusting the grind or adjusting the amount?  Is there a trick to this?  Is there something grinding finer will do for me which adding extra coffee will not, and vice versa?",1610894000

Coffee,iHoffs,kz6a83,"Sette 270Wi, Eureka Specialita or other for variety-ish (?) grinding"," I have been looking at something higher end to upgrade from my cheap-ish manual hario grinder and would like to just get a single machine. Currently I am mostly using v60 and aeropress but I would like to get a espresso machine (Rancilio Silvia or something) in the future which would be main method at that point. So I would like a grinder that could accommodate for something like v60/aeropress grind but would also be capable of espresso grind.

I've seen a lot of talk about ""dialing in"" being an issue or waste, but since I don't expect to be switching a lot from v60 to espresso I feel like that shouldn't be an issue. What I am just looking really is a grinder that can do both.

First I was looking at Sette 270Wi, but there are tons of people saying that it can't really do anything besides espresso (even though the manufacturer claims 3 (good) for manual and 5 (exceptional) for espresso).

Then I found that Eureka Specialita sells for roughly the same here and they claim to be able to do all the way from French to espresso which sounds great.

Lastly I saw a lot of recommendations for Niche Zero, but being in EU and with current Brexit situation on their page (+ long wait time) I feel like this is not really an option as they do not have any resellers.

So bottom line, I am looking for something that I could get now and would not have an issue transitioning from coarser (french press, V60, aeropress) to espresso in the future.

Thanks for any comments.",1610889440
Coffee,kevinlar,kz4mfa,Confused about V60 and bitterness,"I have been making V60 now for a couple of months, I roughly follow Hoffman's method - 18g coffee to 300g water, pouring over a total time of 1:45 inc a 45s bloom. I was reasonably happy with the cups even though I was getting something like a 5 min drawdown time, which seems to be pretty long from what I've read.

I have just recently upgraded from a Hario mini mill to a Comandante C40. First impression - wow! the Comandante grinds so much more consistently - I didn't even realise how inconsistent my old grinder was. I have made 2 cups now with the new grinder, at 20 clicks and 25. I'm getting a much faster drawdown, 3-3:30 and the grinds are noticeably coarser at these settings (especially 25 clicks) than what I was using with the previous grinder. What I've noticed though, is that the cup tastes slightly bitter, and I've lost the sweetness that I had before.

Why would this be the case? My understanding is that a coarser grind (with way less fines) and a faster drawdown should lead to LESS extraction, which I thought was meant to make things more acidic rather than more bitter.

The cups I am getting with the new grinder are undoubtedly cleaner than before, and I'm really looking forward to getting things dialed in as I just KNOW that it's going to taste great when I do.",1610881831

I felt so affirmed by this recent video from James Hoffmann about percolation vs immersion [(linked here)](https://youtu.be/09fNvoQMlGw) \- I've tried so hard with so many other brewing methods, but the Aeropress inverted method is simply the best quality coffee one can achieve when home brewing - in every single category.

* Do you like a french press? The Aeropress inverted method lets you steep just as long as you would with the french press.
* Do you like a clear cup? Use the paper filters and it's just as clear as a paper-filtered pour over.
* Do you like an easy cleanup? You press out the puck, rinse, and you're done.
* Do you like a full pot of coffee in the morning? Use more grounds, dilute with semi-boiling water, press into a separate carafe, and the little thing makes an entire pot of pseudo americano on its own!
* Minimizing waste? Order a metal filter and it's zero waste.

I've tried so many methods:

* Moka pot can make some good coffee, but it's a bit fickle and scary. It's nice to get that high concentration though.
* Perhaps I just lack the skill, but *pour overs are too easy to mess up*. I've spent weeks with a timer, a scale, and all different grinds and roasts from a friend that worked at a nice coffee shop, and I can't seem to consistently get coffee I really love. V60, chemex, kalita cup, paper and metal filters, perfect roast, perfect grind, perfect ratios, whatever I do is just not good enough.
* I *love* espresso, but I don't want to spend &gt;$500 on machine with high enough pressure.
* French press is alright, but I don't want a centimeter of mud at the bottom of my mug.

The very first thing I noticed is that this brewer retains a lot of water, that the regular v60 brewer. It easily allowed me to bloom 25gms of coffee with 50gms water. Using the regular brewer, I have to bloom with 3x water, as it starts dipping quickly.

So basically, because this brewer retains more water and slows down drip rate, allowing more time for brewing than the regular v60 brewer.

The resulting cup was quite good. It was certainly less bitter than usual, but wasn't as sweet as JH's French Press/cupping technique. I shall try tweaking the grind, so get the similar results as cupping/FP.

Sometimes certain tastes, smells, or rituals remind you of good times or happy places. It doesn't necessarily have to be the best method, the best roast, or the best brew, but it still is drinkable and makes you feel all warm inside.

For me, it's brewing percolator coffee on the stove in an old-school glass top, stainless steel basket percolator. It reminds me of Christmas mornings at my parents' house on the lake, and waking up to the sound and smell of coffee perking and the snow outside.

Even if it doesn't always make the most consistent brew, or the best-tasting, I still love to drink it this way despite having other methods like a French Press, cveze, pour over...

When brewing a single shot, the espresso dribbles out nicely and fills the shot in about 20-30 sec. 

When using the double filter, the espresso barely drips into the glasses and takes minutes to fill. 

I purchased fresh espresso ground beans (whole beans put through grinder at grocery store on espresso setting). They are a very fine powdery consistency. And I packed the grounds very tightly into the filter.

Any ideas? Pack too tight? Beans ground too fine? Bad machine? The drip holes below the filter did seem to have coffee powder in them afterwards, maybe this is the issue?

We are new to making espresso ourselves and appreciate any tips! 

The final cup with a teaspoon of homemade vanilla simple syrup, the espresso, and frothed milk tastes great, but I’m thinking there is something wrong with our process or the machine.",1610810916

I just moved and started unpacking my Rancilio Silvia E 2020, which I bought during first wave lock down.

Now today when started it up, I  noticed the water coming out too quickly. I also noticed slight ""leak"" like a small string of water spewing out on the side. However I tried adjusting grinding on Niche Zero because I had recalibrated it hoping that would be the problem.

However the water is just flossing out. I've never experienced it before, leading me to think there is a problem with the pressure valve? Rancilio Silvia E 2020.

I finally managed to remove the spout and place the Pressure gauge. See video on how it is. It kinda stays on 9 bar but its leaking. Is this normal?

What is going? I can't identify the problem.

When I first turned it on, I usually let 300ml water through on both grouphead and steam wand. I let water through steam wand a couple of seconds, then closing the tap again. However I actually forgot to turn off the water pump for the hot water during the whole 300ml water pouring. Could this lead to malfunctioning?

Please help is needed.

When filtering the concentrate from the grounds in a paper filter i find that i cant do a pourover with room temp water several times with the resulting liquid still being quite concentrated. 

Normally i do 2 passes with a pourover with the first being the most concentrated and the second pass requiring a 50:50 ratio with water:concentrate. 

I tried pouring a third time and drank it as is and i gota say the brew is not only excellent but still quite concentrated. It could still be ok to 50:50 this in my opinion if you want a lighter brew. 

The interesting thing is this brew tastes complete and really full bodied despite being diluted 3 times. Imagine an espresso shot diluted with water at a 50:50 ratio.

Sounds good right.

Yet we are told

A single shot is 1oz or 30ml/grams

A double shot is 2oz or 60ml/grams

Yet using the 1:2 ratio my yield ends up being 36 grams/ml on a double basket

That's less than 2oz (60ml/grams) which is the amount of a double shot.

So shouldn't the ratio of water be HIGHER i.e?

1:(X to get me 2oz/ 60ml) i.e 3.2

So up front, I can't afford an espresso machine, nor do I think, at this point in my life, that it'd be a good buy. My husband isn't a huge fan of coffee and truthfully I'm not sure if I have the patience and time to spend on creating espresso at home. I toyed with a Nespresso for a while, but I just can't get behind the disposable pods even though they're recyclable (or Néstle).

But that said, I'm really missing espresso-based drinks (latté, cappuccino, flat white) and would love to make something similar at home. Doesn't have to be true espresso, but anything that can get me close to that.

I've tried the Moka pot and french press milk frother route, but it's been difficult. I have a crap Moka pot I bought at a garage sale for $5, and doing the milk frother in the french press always makes a mess and the whole thing takes forever.

I'm leaning towards a new Moka pot and buying a milk frother. Any thoughts on that, or other avenues? Any tips for making Moka pot coffee actually taste good? I'd say our budget is around $150 CAD (but could go higher if cost/benefit is there).

Thanks!

I recently bought sage barista express, so for first two weeks I was using supermarket beans, illy and starbucks and some random brand. It was very easy to dial in with them, i sticked to 3-5 grind setting and usually had to increase the dose and give a good tamp, my pressure was pretty much always in ""Perfect range"" and timing was good, also the yield and taste was perfect.  


After 2 weeks of doing good coffee with supermarket beans i decided to buy some ""Premium beans"" that are freshly roasted, bought some medium-dark roast and now have absolute nightmare trying to dial.  


At low grind setting 3-5, and normal 18g dose and good tamp, pressure would skyrocket and extraction would be really slow and coffe ends up thick.  


With higher grind setting 8-10, if i use same dose of 18g and give a good tamp, it's  the same. If i decrease the dose and dont tamp as hard the pressure goes to higher end of ""espresso range"" and extraction is very fast, also the auto mode no longer gives 30-40g, the yield has increased to like 100-150g lol, i never reprogrammed it?

Coffee,SirCabbage420,kt8i6x,I do not drink any sort of caffeine but even 10mg of caffeine makes me feel more hyper. 30mg leads me to feel overwhelming hyper and a cup of coffee makes me so hyper that I cant focus on anything and potentially leads to a panic attack.

I have loved coffee all my life and have never been ""addicted"" to it but have had periods where I've indulged daily. I could easily stop  drinking it and go back to it all throughout high school with no problem. Then I had my first panic attack on caffeine and haven't been the same since. After that, i would ""feel"" the effects of the coffee when it used to just be unnoticeable. Even if i drank a cup of cold brew at 4pm, i would sleep fine and feel totally normal.

But ever since that day, I've had caffeine effect me more and more intensely every time i try to go back to it. As in, ill try some for a few days, the stress and mental effects will be too much then ill stop. This occurred for about a year until i had another panic attack after trying a cup of coffee.

Having read the brief guide on here that mentioned the Hario Skerton grinders and the online hype over thr Timemore C2 I thought they would be a good starting point. I did look at amazon reviews for similarly priced electric grinders which were positive but I get the impression at my budget a manual grinder would produce better results. We only drink 1 cup each a day so don't need to bulk grind. 

The Hario is a bit cheaper and I think I prefer the glass aesthetic however I hoped some of you may have experience of both. 

The main coffee style would be pour over using a bodum pour over Maker but we also have a duo temp Pro which I use. 

Are either of them capable of pour over and espresso grinds? The main factor would be coarser as it is a gift for someone that uses a pour over maker most of the time but if either would be suitable for dual use that would be ideal. 

If you have a view if there is a better option for around the same price which is £40-£60 please let me know why not just a model name as I will end up back here with more questions.

Coffee,jxdlam,kszyb1,Troubleshooting a bitter cold brew,"Hi all, I just started diving into cold brew and would like to seek help for those who are using [Hario Filter-in Coffee bottle](https://global.hario.com/pickup_fic_m.html) along with the given recipe. 

TL:DR - 50g beans, 750g water (inclusive of filter and grounds weight), 18 hours - turned out bitter. (question below)

Beans used: Brazil Cerrado, medium-dark, 50g (roasted 2 days ago)

Grinder: Timemore C2, 24 clicks

Water: Filter water, room temperature

Process: Grinded beans fresh and put all into filter. Poured water in through the filter with a bit of time in between to let the beans soak through. I didn't measure the amount of water but the water level reached the approx 750ml mark (inclusive of the weight from grounds and filter)

At the 10th hour mark, I took a small sip (by opening the cap and not pouring through the grounds) and found the taste to be weird (there was a weird aftertaste that i couldn't describe as bitter so decided to deem it acidic - it didn't taste chocolately at all). I put in back into the fridge thinking it might be underextracted.

At the 12th hour mark, I took another sip (similiar method) and still had the same issue with the taste.

Had to go out for appointment and when i got back at around the 18th hour mark, I took out the filter, gave the bottle a good shake and drank a mouthful. Taste was woody with aftertaste, but still no chocolately flavor.

Question: I would like to fix it but unsure where to start.

Thinking if i should adjust the following while keeping everything else the same and test at 8, 12 and 16th hour (stopping at whichever is flavourful or woody)

1) Increase the grind to medium-coarse (20 clicks?) 

2) Add 5g of grounds but stick to the same grind

Any other suggestions or analysis is greatly welcome. 

Thanks!",1610102007

Coffee,applysauce,ksjs88,OXO Brew 8-cup experience (for smaller batches),"I recently got this brewer. I think it makes good tasting coffee without fuss, but it doesn't seem to work as well for brewing smaller amounts of coffee. My understanding and experience is that drip brewers tend to do better when brewing more coffee (without adjusting the coffee:water ratio). Since this brewer includes a small batch insert, I thought it might perform just as well when brewing less coffee.

The coffee maker works well when using the 4-8 cup setting, brewing at least 40 grams of coffee (in a typical 1:16 or 17 ratio). I've used the smaller single-serve insert plus the smaller filters to try brewing a smaller amount of coffee (25-35 g), but these tend to taste more watery. I've used up the included filters and have begun using the pricey Kalita wave filters (which seem similar to the included filters). (Note, for brewing 4-8 cups, walmart paper basket filters do just fine.) My grind is appropriate since I'm using pre-ground coffee for these experiments, which is way more uniform that what my current grinder can produce.

Coffee,klausa,ksir35,Superautomatic machine for an office of ~30-50 people!,"Heyo!

My company is moving offices and that means we need to get our own coffee machine, which I’ve been pulled in to help out with picking.

I originaly wanted to get the Breville/Sage Oracle Touch, but I’ve been (ultimately, I think correctly) vetoed, saying that nobody is going to learn how to use portafilters and clean them properly.

So, into the realm of superautomatics we go. The problem is I know literally nothing about those — and am asking you for help :)

We’re probably looking at like \~60-ish drinks a day? It needs to be easy to use, and relatively easy to clean and maintain. It’d be perfect if it could steam milk and do cappuccinos/etc automagically to.

Sourcing good beans isn’t a problem, since we’re located in Berlin :)

We’re looking at probably \~2000 Euro budget here? I could maybe expand that a little bit, but not wildly so.

Or is the entire enterprise at this price range pointless, and I should let someone else pick a „meh” machine, and advocate for a separate, nice pourover setup for those who want to spend more than 30s brewing their coffee? 

(I tried googling for reviews of superautomatics, but all permutations of „superautomatic coffee review” are so astro-turfed to death, I didn’t really trust anything I read.)

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1610042579

I got a chemex for Christmas and have been loving it so far. I have watched YouTube videos on how to do it and have been getting good results. The one problem I am having is my grinder, I just have one of the cheap blade grinders which is causing the grounds to be uneven.

Coffee,mastley3,kshz88,"Too much caffeine, or not enough?","
I am not good at sleeping any more. I'm in my mid-40s. Used to sleep like a baby, but now, almost every night, I fall asleep quickly, but struggle to stay asleep through the night. I often have several hours where I am restless, and occasionally cannot sleep at all after, say 4 am.

As I result, I had been drinking a bit less coffee. I generally do pourovers at 18g, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon. I had been cutting back on the amount in my afternoon cup, hoping that in doing so, I would lessen the amount of caffeine in my system, and therefore get through the night more easily. Ive gotten down to 13g, but the impact on my sleep has not been significant.

Recently, I heard (maybe not for the first time) that the good feeling of drinking coffee in the morning is not from the stimulation of caffeine, but from relief from caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I have heard for years that caffeine doesn't actually ""wake you up"" but that it blocks a receptor for the hormone that makes us sleepy, so this makes a bit of sense.

So my experiment for today is to go back to drinking more in the afternoon. Maybe I can hit an amount where my withdrawal hits at 7, when I'm supposed to wake up???

Does anyone have experience with this? Am I crazy (its the sleep deprivation!)?",1610040365
Coffee,blazerz,kshqs6,"Got a Timemore C2 manual grinder today. I am a complete newbie at coffee, I need some help regarding grind settings","I just started getting into coffee a few months ago, when a friend gave me a French press as a gift. I have since purchased an Aeropress but generally stuck to preground coffee until now, when I got a Timemore C2. It was delivered today. My beans came yesterday.

As I understand it, the 0 point for measuring grind settings is where the dial stops while turning it towards 'fine'. I did some research and decided to set the grind to 20 for my aeropress. While the cup I brewed was heavenly, and I definitely understand why one should go for freshly ground over pre ground, the grind seemed a little coarser than the preground stuff I am used to. (All the coffee vendors here let you pick the grind type when you order, and they are classified 'French press', 'aeropress' etc instead of numbers. You pick the grind type according to the equipment you have.)

Am I doing this right? Is the 0 point really how I described it? Is the grind setting I've used today actually optimal for Aeropress? If I'm understanding this correctly, the finest setting should be 0.",1610039699

Coffee,pjhenry1216,kshfgj,Cleaning grinder more important than I thought,"So, I was lazy and figured since I use my grinder everyday that it wouldn't really get clogged or 'dirty'. But I decided, why not, so I took it apart (baratza virtuoso+) and didn't do anything drastic, just used the included cleaning brush and wiped out the burrs, etc. Well, I solved the mystery of why my grind size has slowly been getting 'bigger.' Over time, I've noticed that I have been slowly moving the indicator to the right and was slightly perplexed why I've been having to do this when I recall getting good coffee at a 'smaller' grind without overextracting. Well, it seems that it was slowly clogging and causing the grind size to get smaller all on its own and I was just covering up the symptom. My first cup after grinding had much larger particles which I didn't notice til I was done brewing and looking at the coffee bed. It also brewed much faster so I ended up with a fairly under extracted cup, *but* I feel I learned something and helped make past experiences make more sense.

tl;dr Apparently not cleaning a grinder can lead to it creating smaller than expected grind particles. So, clean your grinder.",1610038828

Coffee,edamlambert,kudw9z,Tasting coffee is harder than I thought.,"I've been trying to get into coffee past few months and got my first grinder like month or two ago. I realized that to get most out of it, I have to be able to adjust it right. And to do that I have to be able to taste what is wrong in the cup in the first place.

Today I did a small test or tasting. I brewed two small cups of filter coffee, one with coarsest grind I got out from my grinder and another one with the finest grind. My goal was to find out how over extracted coffee tastes like and vice versa how under extracted coffee tastes like.

Once I got all set up and started slurping, at first I couldn't tell what the difference between the two cups was. They pretty clearly tasted different, but I couldn't tell myself what the difference was. As the cups cooled down tasting got easier.

Still pretty much all I learned from this was what the ""bitter"" meanswhen talking about over extracted coffee. I couldn't 
distinguish any clear tastes from the under extracted version. Again I tasted something, but I didnt't find any words for it. Maybe it was too coarse so there really wasn't much to taste.

I think I'll try this again some day, but go less extreme with the grind settings. Maybe it would be easier to taste then.

From my understanding of the [espresso compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-espresso-compass/) it means that I'm over-extracting and should decrease yield. But if I do that, my time variable will move as well and I will end up with a 15 seconds shots, so I am a bit lost.

What variable should I change to try to improve my espresso?

Setup :

* Gaggia Classic 2012 with PID + Pre-infusion (1.5s pre-infusion + 2.5s delay before actually pulling the shot)
* Niche Zero on 10
* VST 18g basket + Naked PF
* 58mm coffee distribution tool + 58.6mm tamper

I don't know if it counts, but I tamped as hard as I could to make one less variable to worry about from shot to shot.",1610225423

So I would much rather have iced coffee and I do drink it often ( I buy the Starbucks iced coffee blonde roast and it's perfect ), but sometimes I enjoy a hot cup. So I have fresh flavored light roast coffee, and I measured out two tablespoons of grounds, added 6 oz of water ( I had a small mug and it fit fine ). Brewed it on bold because the instructions said use Bold if you're using flavored grounds. The cup ends up being much less water than I initially put in. I assume cause it's soaked up in the grounds? I added creamer, and it's just...not good. It's almost salty. 

So I guess I'm just looking for answers I'm sure you pros already know lol. Do I add more water next time? Do I try to brew it on the regular setting and not bold? I literally cannot screw this up but somehow I am. I used to brew coffee in a mini teapot in my younger years and never had any issues so it's driving me mad! Lol

Then, even when I look at a random sample of the businesses I use, or that they say they use, there's just more men, especially at the top.

Such a weird experience with this one.   
It brews pretty good in a Moka Pot and decently in a Aeropress. Really balanced, like really realy - it looks like it is pretty hard ot mess it up. Also pretty flat as a taste - good but super flat and without anything going on (which is also not that bad).   
What surprised me the most tho is that the one I got was relatively old - it was brewed a few months ago, but it kept its taste for thru the 2 weeks i've been drinking it.

Can this all be because of too much caffeine?  Also having headache rn but like 5hours later after i drank last time. one green tea bag (lipton) should have like 70mg caffeine per bag? ( If yes then i drink 240-380mg caffeine daily ) If its possible and most likely because of green tea, i will quit drinking it daily. i would love to hear yall own experiences and advices from someone who knows more than i do. if it matters then i am 16yo and naturaly having low tolerance and  very sensitive to substances.

Coffee,mldsmith,l01uhn,V60/Niche Zero Grind Setting/Extraction Time,"Hi All,

Been playing around with pour over recently (I primarily drink espresso) as I really enjoy the clarity I get from cafes in town with their pour over offerings. I am struggling to recreate the same cup at home. I end up with what I perceive as over-extraction (bitter, too much body, muddy flavours) and a relatively long (4:00+) extraction time, wondering if the issue is grind time or technique, or something else.

Recipe: 20g coffee, 300g water (212F) 1:15 ratio medium roast blend [Longitude 123 from 49th Parallel Roasters](https://49thcoffee.com/collections/blends/products/123-w-longitude-blend)

Workflow: Preheat much and rinse/preheat ceramic V60 with hot tap water for a few minutes while kettle heats up. When kettle comes to temp grind beans (I have been grinding around step 40 - between ""filter drip"" and ""coarse"" settings, dose into V60 and dig a little hole in the middle. Bloom 60g water, give a little swirl, let sit for 45s. Slowly pour in circles to 200g or so over the next 45-60s, let draw down to just above the coffee bed, slowly pour up to 300g, swirl again (maybe 3 total rotations) and let it draw down. I get some stalling where flow slows a lot for the last 50g of water or so. 

Any feedback? I had this in the 49th parallel cafe and it was really bright, ""tea like"", with notes of apple and nuts. I get a lot of bitterness and not as much acidity in my cup.",1610998366

So I bought a large package of (supposedly?) Geisha beans from a different store, which was pretty pricey. How can I tell that I have real Geisha beans? Every brew I've tried, with different ratios, temperatures and coarseness tastes terrible. It's a bitter and sour, almost astringent, taste, no acidity and no sweetness whatsoever. Nothing like last time.

I tried extending brew time by making the grind finer, by adding more water (about 1:17), got it all the way to ~3.5min. Still, bitter/sour/astringent. Any tips before I call this wasted money? 🙂",1610995812

I'm still struggling to understand the process of dialing in my grind for a particular coffee on the V60. One thing I've begun to suspect is that the grind quality is quite different if I single dose vs. loading the hopper and dosing based on grind time (and confirming with a scale). I'm guessing that this is due to the difference between all the beans being weighted down by the ones above in a timed grind, vs. the beans sort of bouncing around on the burrs in a single dose. I'd love to know if this is correct and what the difference in the grind and the resulting pourover would likely be? Thanks for any insight you all can provide.",1610994250

Still smells great and now has me bouncing off the walls and borderline turned my stomach but still tastes like hot water.  Its so frustrating and ive wasted some good coffee experimenting.

Coffee,yoked_shoat,kzzcwt,"How many people have found that exact ratios, water temps, brewing time etc. seem to be somewhat unimportant in the quality of coffee?","This isn't meant to dismiss the science/art of brewing in any way. I think the meticulous pursuit of the perfect cup of coffee is a valid one. I used to be really particular about my process. Recently however, I've become a bit more relaxed about the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been my morning routine for the past few months:

\-I just filled up my grinder to the top. No scale. Somewhere around 40 grounds, but could vary slightly. Put the grounds in the french press.

\-I boil water in the kettle and then wait for the bubbles to stop before I pour. Sometimes it's like 20 seconds. Sometimes I'm multitasking and I wait 45 seconds to a minute.

\-Fill the french press up with water till about the halfway point (500 grams but far from exact). Some days I want more coffee so I pour a little more water in. Maybe 2/3s full, so like 700 grams. I never compensate with more coffee because my grinder fits as much as it does and I'm always too lazy re-fill with beans and grind more.

\-Let it sit for at least 4 minutes and usually less than 10. But sometimes I forget about it while I'm doing something else and pour after 20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

AND DESPITE all of my inconsistency, the coffee I brew is consistently great. The only thing that seems to affect my coffee is the ingredients. Fresh beans and filtered water does the trick every time, no matter what else I change. 

Maybe my taste isn't refined enough to notice the small details that change  with each variation in the process. I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar. Let me know :)",1610991353

They are actually more inconvenient cleaning-wise. I gotta do multiple vinegar+water brews, as well as clean visible dirtiness in the accumulates on the other parts of the machine.

Makes amazing coffee, but filling it to the top only makes for a 350g cup of coffee. It claims to hold 20 oz but when you account for space at the top for the filter and space at the bottom for grounds, you are getting barely half that.

Then I bought the [Bialetti 3 cup moka pot](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Bialetti-Moka-Express-Stovetop/dp/B0000CF3Q6). I don't know why they would even claim '3 cups' when it makes 150g of coffee max. It's enough for one very small cup. Really it's more suited for a faux espresso.

Then I bought the [3 cup chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html). Makes about 500g of coffee, so maybe a cup and a half or two small cups. But any more than that and the filter will touch the water at the bottom. And the top is too small for anything larger than a 100g pour, so if you are trying to make larger batches you will have to do many pours, not ideal for pour over.

I got a bialetti 4-cup induction pot for christmas (which I LOVE).

The issue is that about 50% of the time I get a full top-pot of coffee, and 50% of the time it starts sputtering about half way.

My method is this:

1. Boil kettle with Brita filtered water
2. Grind 15g of coffee fresh using an Aergrind set to 1:3
3. Fill bottom chamber with 160-165g water (just below the valve)
4. Put coffee into basket &amp; level off (no tamping, just swiping my finger across a couple of times to make sure there isn't a mountain)
5. Screw top on and set burner to 4.5  (out of 9)
6. Wait for coffee - 5-6 minutes to see the flow start, maybe another 2-3 before sputtering.
7. Run the base under cold water to stop sputtering.

Sometimes it works perfectly, sometimes not.

The basket *can fit* 16-17g of coffee in if I *really* tap the sides to get it all to level down, but 15g seems to work better

The inside of the moka pot is clean - it gets washed after each use and I've removed + cleaned the rubber gasket once a week.

I was looking into making coffee at home because going to Starbucks gets prohibitively expensive over the long term. I got a moka pot a few months ago, but the time and attention it takes makes me skip it in the morning and I still haven't managed to make it taste very good at all.

I was looking into buying the Bonavita 1900TS (or 1500TS) and a Baritizia Encore Grinder or maybe the Harrio mini, but I read that without brewing at least a few cups at a time, there's no way it'll brew at the proper temperature to make the SCAA rating mean anything. Brewing more seems like a terrible waste as I would just throw it away. I was also thinking of possibly just buying a Nespresso machine for cheap since it would be single serving. (I am aware of the awful environmental impact of pod based systems)

I normally drink lattes, cappuccinos, and drip coffee with milk from Starbucks and even though its objectively probably ""bad"" coffee, I really do enjoy it. I'm also slightly worried getting a taste for ""good"" coffee will make me enjoy it less for getting coffee at places like Starbucks with friends or to meet people. Is it worth it to invest in a decent machine and grinder if I'm only ever making coffee for myself? Or would getting a Nespresso despite its drawbacks make sense? Thanks!",1610925890

The quickest way, without needing to buy a stand-alone device, will probably be to set up a double boiler on the stove to heat the milk up. But that would require active involvement as I want the milk temp to fall within a certain range. I guess I could set up a thermometer to beep when it hits 145F?

Today, I tried to put the cold milk into the Ikea FP and sous vide it. Everything worked pretty well. The only downside of this is that it takes a while. Roughly 15 minutes for the water bath to reach 145, and another 10-15 minutes for the milk to reach temp. But minimal involvement needed and no chance of burning the milk by heating for too long.

Anyone have other methods for warming milk? I haven't tried the toaster oven yet as I think it would take longer than sous vide, but not sure really.",1610916630

For that reason, I was wondering if there's an ""all around"" grinder that creates perfect grounds for any type of coffee (pour over, espresso, cold brew, etc.)

This grinder would be strictly for home use. I make 3-4 cups of coffee in the morning every day and some days (sometimes I don't do this for a couple weeks) I grind quite a bit for a weekly cold brew batch (maybe 8-12 cups or more). I was looking at the HG-1 simply because it fits into my price range of under $1000, but my range isn't fixed and I'd easily pay double if there's another grinder out there that does it all and won't give me any hassle for many years. I read from one poster that, while the HG-1 is very well made and looks beautiful, it eventually got old for him to manually grind. I do also share this fear. I'm also not sure whether I should be going conical vs. flat. Based on my research, everyone seems to have their own opinion on the matter.

When using my V60 I notice that during the bloom the coffee expands so much that the “slurry” looks more like a small chocolate cake than it does coffee. It expands a ton and forms a dome shape. The problem is that when I start my second pour, the dome deflates and immediately causes channeling, which is obviously not good.

Does this mean there’s too much gas in the beans? And if so, how do I mitigate this problem.

For reference, I’m using a medium roast Ethiopia and grinding it in my Timemore C2. The grind size doesn’t seem to matter - I’ve tried everything from medium-coarse to fine, but the problem remains.

Coffee,Acavia8,kz9hdt,Matching grind size to brew time,"The James Hoffmann video about immersion vs percolation made me rethink grind size.  I re-read a Specialty Coffee Association 2010 presentation, with much of it discussing matching grind size with brew time  - see one of the summary slides attached.   


Since getting a new grinder last May, I have always started with its filter setting at 5, 500 microns and often gone finer.  A 5 grind looks close to powder and when I have gone to 4 and into 3s, it is probably close to espresso.  I mostly brew Ethiopian coffee. Most Ethiopian coffees in a V60 at a 5 grind, finish around 3:30 with about a 35 second bloom.  Subtracting the bloom, it is brewing around 3:00 minutes, which would indicate over extraction based on that SCA chart as they find optimal brew time for 500 microns under 2 minutes. Based on experience with my grind, I assumed a 6 grind, 600 microns, would likely hit closer to its place on that chart.    


Today I ground a coffee, that I had been doing at a 5, on a 6.  It finished at 3:06 with a 35 second bloom.  So it probably did brew as long as it should to hit that graph. It was very good.  The resulting coffee was already very good at a 5 grind, and was consistent from brew to brew.  At a 6 it was noticeably more smooth and tasted more complete/richer. Its brightness was about the same - it did not get more acidic.  Tomorrow I will try a 5.75 which should hit closer to a point on the graph.

Coffee,yelppely1122,kz8105,Pour Overs and Blends,"In recent years I’ve gotten a bit more particular about my daily cup of coffee. But unlike something like beer or wine, I’m pretty hesitant to try something new at home. First, buying a bag of new beans requires me to consider adjusting ratio, brew time, and grind size to achieve my preferred cup. Plus, it’s possible I just won’t care for the coffee as much as my go-to* and will be locked into coffee that leaves me a bit unsatisfied for a couple of weeks while I finish the bag. So... at home, I’m pretty dialed in. 

But... when I go out, I can’t wait to try something new. I love getting pour overs around town or when visiting new places. Generally, I’m looking for lower acidity, milk chocolate, toffee... those sorts of flavors. For whatever reason, after reading coffee descriptions, I frequently land on a blend. Often, if I ask the barista for a blend pour over they will try to steer me towards a single origin roast instead. I’m a firm believer in “drink what you like” so I don’t sweat it too much. But... is there some reason that I shouldn’t be using blends for pour overs? I understand the interest in tasting a single origin — and I’m happy to try one when the flavors line up. But, also, I get kind of excited to see what different rosters come up with for their blends. In some ways that seems to be a better way to experience a new shop since the roaster has taken more variables into their own hands. 

Anyway, is there another perspective out there? Should I consider focusing on single origins for pour overs when I’m at a new place? Just trying to understand why baristas seem to hesitate when I choose a blend.

Coffee,andcarro,l7s53j,Monogram Coffee Appreciation Post,"My wife and I have always been into coffee (or - we thought we were into coffee). We typically would seek out local roasters, and we had tried a couple of subscription boxes but never been terribly impressed.

On Black Friday 2020, Monogram was having a special - 50% off of your first two subscription orders. I was a little skeptical - it was committing to a decent amount of coffee, and it's not inexpensive (though it's certainly not extraordinarily so, especially for subscription savings).

I wasn't going to buy - but the owner of Monogram was in the Black Friday Deal Thread, and seemed like a really nice person - so I pulled the trigger on two subscriptions - 6 bags each of the roasters choice and classic filter. We gave a couple of bags as gifts where we got duplicates, but kept 8 bags for ourselves and stored unopened in individual airtight containers to do our best to keep quality up to the extent possible.

The result? An entirely new appreciation for different coffees. The quality of the coffees far exceeds that of local roasters I have access to (though I'll still support them). Each coffee genuinely felt like an experience. 

My favorite was the Karogoto AA - my wife is devastated it's not currently available to order more. Her favorite coffee she has ever had.

As we are finishing our last bag now, it's the Luz Marina Quintero. I often see tasting notes on bags, and really don't see the follow through or ""get"" them. This is a lighter bodied and complex tasting coffee, and the notes of yogurt and black cherry are absolutely spot on. It's opened us up to trying more. It's not feasible for us to order daily drivers from Monogram, but if you have the means and haven't tried them - I could not recommend them more highly.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with Monogram - I just wanted to encourage others to try it as they've changed the way we view coffee in my house.",1611925808

Coffee,Quirky-Dimension-499,l7qf7v,Brewing pour-over with low doses,"When I really started to get into coffee about a year ago, I found that I wanted to punctuate my day more often with the break that making a pour-over provides - especially now I'm working from home.

I realised that brewing with 20g(ish) every time I wanted a coffee was a lot of caffeine, and decaf can be good but its taste is generally not as good as 'normal coffee'.

So my question is: **Do you have a pour-over recipe using 10g(ish) that you like?**

Here's my current recipe (vaguely inspired by Tetsu and April)

\- coarse grind (traditional French press size), 10g light (or light-medium) roast

\- water straight off the boil

\- 25g bloom (drain through completely), 50g pour (then 45 seconds), take the total water up to 160g with one slowish pour.

Doesn't take long to drain through overall, and it's a very clear cup of coffee - good acidity and sweetness - not a lot of body, that's how I like it.

Recently ive taken 2 cups of coffee at once, and i get this very intense euphoria at the peak, and honestly feels almost as good as any euphoric drugs ive taken.

But coffee doesnt interact with any areas causing euphoria, right? Does anyone know any scientific explanation for this? Or is it just me being ""addicted""?",1611897615
Coffee,howdy_bc,l7ive9,"Is manually prepared coffee all that different from instant coffee, or am I crazy?","I've always drunk instant coffee all my life. Coffee culture is not a thing, really, in India, (we have the best tea, though) and most of us prepare instant coffee at home. (It's ridiculously cheap; a sachet costs ₹2 ($0.027) and makes a large mug of coffee. Hard to beat.)

I've been lurking this sub for a while, decided to give it a shot. Bought coffee beans, we already had a grinder, and made coffee with manual methods I found online. Things I tried:

Cowboy coffe (with grounds put in from the start).

Cowboy coffe (with grounds put in after the water is hot).

Pour over coffee, with filter paper.

I gotta be honest, I don't taste much of a difference? These three methods had only a slight difference in taste from each other (pour over being the best), and taste pretty much identical to the instant coffee we get in stores. The only noticeable difference is in the aftertaste: this coffee leaves a stronger aftertaste in the mouth compared to instant coffee. I do like that.

Is this normal? Should I really buy a coffee machine or french press? Will there be a substantial difference, or is it just super subtle? I want to have better coffee, but I feel like I'm going crazy.

P.S. The coffees we get in cafeterias are pretty shit. Instant coffee in 100% milk tastes better. So I have no frame of reference either, other than the vividly snobby blogs online and the coffee I've made myself in the past.

Coffee,aggressive-baseball1,l7i2gj,Cold brew ratio confusion?,"So I’m far less experienced than most here, I was attempting to make cold brew for the first time and after further reading I’m pretty sure what I have soaking in the fridge is the entirely wrong ratio. I was reading online different ratios people were using, I read a common one is 1:4 ratio of coffee to water. Seemed pretty simple to me so I put a 1 cup of coarse ground coffee i ground at the store into 4 cups of cold water and I’m now finding out these ratios apply to the beans pre-grind. Most also refer to things in weight rather than volume and I do not have a food scale so I’m pretty clueless as to what I’m going to get as a final product. Will it need to be diluted or am I brewing a super weak cold brew? I could not find much for ratios in volume or post grind, I don’t have a grinder at home either so I don’t have the advantage of measuring out my beans on the spot.",1611891433
Coffee,theledman,l7hyl3,[Gear][Video] Turn your Baratza Encore/Virtuoso into a zero retention grinder with 3D printing,"I recently purchased the Virtuoso+ which I love but got really tired of smacking and shaking it to get all the grounds out. Sometimes it retains up to 2g of coffee which is a lot when you're only grinding 15g (or annoying when you want to change up your beans if you single dose).

Anyway, I saw [this trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWdcqAEkRgg) which worked really well by forcing air through the grinder to blow all the grounds out. I didn't like how loud it was, especially in the morning, so I designed and 3D printed a bellows attachment that fits between the lid and hopper that allows you to pump more air silently through your grinder and completely empty the grind chamber. Added bonus is that it blows all the chaff out too so it's useful as a cleaning tool.

* Price under $1,200.
* I don't want to use pods.
* Not too big in either width or hight. (I don't have much counter space, and I would like it to go under one of my cabinets if possible.)
* Likely use cases: double shot espressos, some macchiatos and cortados, and maybe an occasional latte in the mix.

Coffee,MattMugiwara,l790qy,Am I crazy? I need some help choosing entry-level equipment.,"Hello everyone, I've been lurking in here for a few days already and I have to say I am enjoying it a lot. I really like how you folks are quite accepting of simple questions from noobs and that's something that's encouraging me to post. 

I would like some help with choosing entry level equipment because it's time for me to start drinking good coffee.

Some background: I've always drank large amounts of coffee, always with a small amount of milk and more sugar than I would like to admit. I would always smoke when drinking which made me be fine with the quality and not worry too much? I have also never ground a coffee bean, I would always get pre-ground coffee, torrefacto/arabica mixture, whatever came my way. I have used a Moka pot for years, then just a cheap drip machine, and for the last 4 or 5 years, a french press which I took quite a liking to (been using the James Hoffmann technique for some months). 
However, I have always enjoyed espressos and lattes from commercial settings, I have worked at bars and learned the basics of pulling a nice shot, controlling the grind a bit, making sure that the coffee fell in a nice way as an indicator of quality, detecting when it was off by taste, etc. 

I always told myself that I was saving ""the good coffee"" for when I quitted smoking and that has recently happened (&gt;2 weeks going strong!). I've upped the amount of coffee I put in my french press and significantly lowered the sugar. The result is that I think I like other methods better? I still remember coffee from espresso machines quite fondly, and when I try to drink the french press without sugar, I don't like it. I guess it's because I'm using bad, stale pre-ground coffee and whatnot, so I'd like to still try french press and aeropress methods with good, freshly ground coffe and see how I like them.

So I am aiming to get a good grinder and most likely a decent home espresso machine. Now, I know that it could be a bit crazy because I'm quite new to the entire world, but given the aforementioned experience I think I would definitely like it. However, I don't wanna get super into modding machines, replacing parts, etc etc. At least not yet. 

I am torn between a few options:

For grinders, I've seen a lot of praise for the Wilfa Svart (145 CHF) but the [page where I'd buy it (local coffee equipment shop)](https://adrianos.ch/shop/maschinen/kaffeemuehlen/wilfa-svart-aroma) says that it isn't suitable for espresso? I haven't seen this in comments in here, is it true? Because I think that would rule it out for me, right?

The other options I was considering are the [Sage (Breville in the US I think) the Dose Control Pro, for 162 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Coffee-grinders/SAGE-The-Dose-Control-Pro-Silver-p568447), or the [Lelit Fred, for 177 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Coffee-grinders/LELIT-Fred-PL043MMI-p478287?selsort=rd) since it also seems to be a good brand. I don't wanna go too high on price since I'm still looking for something entry-level, and above 200 CHF is I think way too much (a Baratza Encore is 255.- for example, since I know it's another common recommendation around here). What do you think? Would you recommend any of those for my purposes? Any other recommendations that are worth checking out at this range? I'm purchasing from Switzerland.

For the espresso machine itself, I think I am quite sold on a [Sage the Bambino Plus for 309 CHF](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/sage-the-bambino-plus-espresso-machines-12009447?pcscpId=1&amp;utm_source=toppreise&amp;utm_campaign=preisvergleich&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=12009447). I watched James Hoffmann video comparing it to some others and I think it matches my needs quite well? Specially since he mentioned it being entry-level for people that don't wanna tinker _too much_. The Gaggia Classic (450 CHF) and Rancilio Silvia (800 CHF???) are out of my budget and I also don't like the extra needed tinkering. I read a few reviews from [uk coffee blog](https://coffeeblog.co.uk/sage-bambino-plus-coffee-machine-review/) and while the guy seems extremely positive (maybe biased?) towards it, I liked how it looks. The only other feasible option (from the machines I know which aren't many) would be a [Lelit Anna for 379 CHF](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s2/product/lelit-anna-espresso-machines-8702068?pcscpId=3&amp;utm_source=toppreise&amp;utm_campaign=preisvergleich&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=8702068) which is again getting a bit too high for my budget. Furthermore, in the video the steamer from the Bambino was praised in comparison to the others, and I think that milk drinks will still be an important part of my repertoire.

As a last/other option, I could buy a [Sage The Barista Express for 449 CHF](https://www.toppreise.ch/price-comparison/Espresso-machines/SAGE-The-Barista-Express-Brushed-Stainless-Steel-p565801), but it is my (maybe wrong) understanding that it's better to have the grinder and the espresso machine separated? and it wouldn't be that much cheaper, only 22 bucks. The only benefit I see is that the Barista uses 15 bars as opposed to the Bambino's 9 bars, but from what I've read you need way better equipment and technical expertise to take full advantage of the 15 bars, and for my level 9 bars would be actually better. It might be completely wrong, but again I enjoyed the uk coffee blog article about it. Whaat do you think? Any other suggestions to check out?

Sorry for the lengthy post, but I am really thankful for your answers and help! Cheers!",1611868380

I've been dabbling in more advanced coffee prep for a while now and I can say I have certainly upped my game and have been able to get superior (to my taste) cups of coffee compared to before. I have almost exclusively used a press since I was 15 and 8 years later (this year) bought a reusable single cup pour over contraption (which I don't like too much because it seems to get clogged a lot). I wouldn't say that I'm a hobbyist, but I do take my prep more seriously compared to my friends. My issue with the pour over, even using a scale has been consistency, which may have  to do with the clogging.

The thing is, this weekend I went to a cottage and for the hell of it tried out the drip coffee machine (Mid-tier Hamilton Beach). To my surprise, I got a great cup of coffee every single time. I'd say on a 1 to 10 scale of my own prep (10 being the best coffee I have ever made), it gave about an 8.5-9. Now I am someone who likes generally likes picking up skills and being challenged, but I can't say that I love it as much on a day to day basis if I can get 90% of what I want with no effort.

So I guess my question is: Can a reasonably priced drip machine be a good choice for day to day usage and reserve the pour over for nicer beans on the weekend when I have the time and will to have the experience or was my experience just blind luck and I should just work on my technique more?",1611862871

Coffee,CreditCardChase,l70w06,"What’s more important, brew ratio or brew time?","For the past few years of my coffee journey I’ve relied on brew ratio to tell me when I’m done brewing. 30g:500g pourover? My grind size could be off and my brew is taking 5min but I won’t remove the brewer from the carafe until it’s drained through. 16g:32g espresso? My grind size could be off and I’ve hit 32g in 20sec but I’ll still turn off the pump. 

But, lately I’ve been experimenting with prioritizing brew time instead. 3.5min into pourover and there’s still liquid draining through the brewer? Pull the brewer off, I’m drinking a stronger ratio today. 30sec into an espresso pull and I only have half my target yield? Stop the pump, I guess I’m having a ristretto.

I’ve only been toying around with this for the past week but it’s drastically improved what would have been “bad” cups. Of course, ideally I’d hit 30:500 in 3.5min for my pourovers and I’ll adjust my grind to hit that next time, but for my last few pourovers 30:400 in 3.5min has tasted significantly better than 30:500 in 4.5min.

I got distracted this morning and instead of letting the slurry sit for 1 minute before pressing, I let it go for 2, which I expected to double the extraction and pull out some very undesired flavors. I didn't have time to complain though, so I threw in a splash of cream and went out the door.

Coffee,bohemian03,l6tivq,Upgrade from Hario Mini Mill - 1Zpresso or Timemore?,"Hello, 

I've recently purchased a V60 and I think it's time to upgrade my manual burr grinder as well. My budget is around 100 EUR and upon research, it seems like 1Zpresso or the Timemore are the best options for my budget. However, each brand has so many different models and series and I was wondering if someone could point me to which brand and model would be best.

My daily driver is the V60 and usually only make coffee for myself (15g). But sometimes, I'd like to make for two people (30g). In addition to the V60, I own an Aeropress and a Moka Pot that I might want to use time to time. 

Thank you!",1611829651

Coffee,overextraction,l4k383,Can immersion have the same strength as espresso?,"What brewing method has the higher possible strength: Immersion or percolation?

In another thread it was argued that because of the faster extraction speed of percolation, espresso can achieve a strength that immersion methods can't. 

I would argue that water has a max concentration of soluble material. Immersion (given enough time) will reach this concentration/strength. Percolation extracts faster, but at best it extracts until it is fully saturated (at the same strength that immersion reaches) and if not ideal, will leave the coffee bed undersaturated. This leads me to the conclusion that immersion and percolation can reach the same strength (all other variables being equal). I would even say that immersion will generally have more strength than percolation. 

If we were to use an espresso grind size and typical espresso ratio in an Aeropress, we should be able to get a strength similar to espresso.

Am I wrong? Does anybody here have a refractometer to verify this?",1611565504

Coffee,GuyThirteen,l4fmye,Constantly swirling a pourover,"We know from extraction theory that percolation brews (such as pourovers) can ultimately extract more than immersion brews because fresh water is constantly being added, and this better facilitates osmosis out of the beans. We also know that the difficulty with pourovers is ensuring even extraction.

So, why not just pour all of your water in one go, while constantly swirling your brew vessel, until you've hit your target weight? It would solve the evenness problem, but it would achieve more extraction than immersion brews because water is constantly being replaced. You'd achieve a complex pourover brew, but with no technical skill required. If you wanted to, you could change extraction speed by just changing pouring speed, and tweak the flavor that way.

I've tried this, and couldn't tell a difference between it and Hoffman's pourover method--but my technique for the latter wasn't perfect, and my pallete is untrained, so I can't make any conclusions. What do you think? And what problems are there with my theory?",1611547858

I don't how weird this sounds, but I tend to not enjoy regular coffee too much because it's just too much liquid for drinking coffee to me. Even regular americanos at that. I prefer smaller and stronger doses, hence the Moka. I know the logical next step would be espresso, but I live on a student budget.

Coffee,JFAT99,l4ataq,"Do combinations of espresso and filter coffee, or two filtering methods, exist?","I recently thought that it might be a good experiment to make a coffee drink based on the blending of two different methods. And it strikes me that there's no evidence of anything like it existing in the internet, which might be for two causes: it's horrible and an extremely bad idea, which someone tried and is ashamed to admit; or no one even thought about it.

What do you say?

I have thought of two possible combinations:

First, some kind of Americano. Espresso and, instead of water, a filtered coffee that maybe should be light and clean (Chemex perhaps), obviously bringing up some tastes the espresso might lack, thus making a complete pallette of flavours.

Second, the combination, now, of two filtered coffees by different methods. Again, obviously, the flavours should complement each other. This can be more experimental in textures, given that two immersion methods can bring up their characteristics (like the sediment and the bitterness), maybe playing among them, or contrasting them with the more sweet and lighter body of the drip methods. In these blends, proportions should play also a major role, I suppose.

And, in both cases, maybe one could also experiment with different beans for each method.

Anyway, let me know what you think.",1611531887

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first.

Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

I was previously using a Bialetti Express 6 cup. Along with a Timemore C2 hand grinder at around 16-17 clicks.

I want to make 3 lattes with the 10 cup. Im following James Hoffmanns tips for using the moka pot. Which involves preheating the water and stopping the cooking process when the moka pot starts to gurgle. Which has lead to some good cups of coffee.

The issue I've encountered so far in multiple attempts is that the lattes made with the 10 cup seems to be less flavorful and kind of watery compared to the 6 cup.

Could anyone provide some advice/tips to help make the coffee less watery or is that just the nature of the beast with the larger moka pots? Any help would be appreciated.

Coffee,dygital7,l42ycm,Help with Fellow EKG - and Buyer Beware in Hong Kong!,"I bought a Stagg EKG about 10 months ago in Hong Kong from Hazel and Hershey (https://www.hazelnhershey.com/)  and I've had some issues with the unit such as in the photo below. The display will show the lines and the unit will stop working requiring a restart. Sometimes the water will be boiling (water spurting out the top) and the temperature read out will still show 80 degrees celcius. Other times, the temperature read out while its boiling will go up and down by about 20 degrees, from 70 to 90. I had believed the unit to be defective so I contacted the retailer and they insisted that the unit was fine even though I told them about all my issues. Since I didn't appreciate that response, I contacted Fellow, who confirmed with me that my kettle was having issues, but since I wasn't located in the US, I would have to go through my retailer.

Well, Hazel and Hershey has basically ghosted me. I sent them multiple messages on instagram and they left me on read, and I also sent them emails which they have not responded to in the last few weeks. I am not sure what I can do to resolve my issue which is why I turn to Reddit. I guess I wanted to see if anyone could point me in some direction of a solution to the faulty kettle such as some other distributor that would honour the warranty or if someone has a contact at Fellow that would apply some pressure from the retailer point of view. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with how Hazel and Hershey has dealt with the situation, and I would urge any readers to avoid purchasing coffee or other products from them. I had bought coffee from them on a weekly basis since they were my favourite roaster in Hong Kong, but it is evident that they don't care about their customers.

For any future potential Fellow customers, make sure you know who you're getting the warranty from, so as to not end up in a situation like me where the retailer ghosts you after you've spent $200 USD, and the manufacturer cannot assist.

Coffee,daniel-k-meme,l41c07,A short anecdote,"So I recently bought a blend from a pretty big local roaster and had been making pourovers in my v60 for my friend and I at work. I consider myself a pretty proficient hobbyist; I've got about 5 or 6 years under me doing pourovers. I spent several cups trying to get it dialed in and, while it was good, it wasn't really anything special to me. I don't usually get blends, so I didn't really know what to expect. It kind of just tasted like generic coffee. I had some other bags from the same roaster I liked much better, so I just decided to grind up quite a bit of that blend and throw it in our $10 walmart autodrip machine - just eyeballing the water level. To my complete surprise, the resulting pot of coffee was absolutely amazing and nothing like how my v60 tasted. Very fruity, chocolatey finish, pretty much perfect in every way. This was by far the best pot of coffee I've ever made in an autodrip machine, let alone the cheapest autodrip machine my friend and I could find (we bought it so we'd have a large volume of coffee to take on jobs with us, not for the quality of said coffee).

So long story short, I'm now working on reevaluating my technique. I think slower pouring is a good place to start to maybe kind of mimic the relatively slow drip of the machine.

Anyway, not here for advice necessarily, just wanted to share a story I found interesting and funny. Happy Sunday.",1611501853

For the last year I've rarely touched my Gaggia classic and have been drinking from my Bialetti/V60 exclusively, but I would like to keep the ability to dial in for espresso as an option.

I was wondering what your grind times with the 1zpresso are. How long does it take to grind about 15-18 grams for pour over?

I parked my car in the open lot where a homeless man immediately blocked off my car and came over to beg for money. Initially, I wasn’t afraid so I ignored him until he started tapping on my window. Going through every worst case scenario in my head I decided against trying to pull out of the lot in case he was armed for whatever reason. I calmly rolled down my window slightly and gave him all the money I had which was roughly $2 in change. At this point, the man walked to the passenger side door and began yanking the handle muttering something about how I needed to take him to the atm and give him a lot of money. Still being afraid he was armed I said that I had to get coffee from the store and couldn’t take him to the atm. To this he said that he would escort me to the store. Inside the store he began screaming “my nephew needs coffee...y’all got coffee??” Repeatedly until the owner showed up. Since he was not wearing a mask, he was promptly kicked out. he turned to me and said he would wait for me outside. I asked the store owner if she minded that I camp out inside until the man left. She was fine with that idea but recommended that she could escort me out and tell the man to leave the property. I agreed and got to my car but the man still followed so the store owner told him to leave. To this the man looked at me and laughed saying, “you should’ve told me, y’all are white suprematists” and then went on his way screaming that we were a bunch of racists.

Hi all,

I bought a Delonghi super automatic coffee machine at the start of covid to get my daily coffee fix whilst working from home, and have been purchasing Jamaica Blue’s (a cafe franchise here in Australia) “signature-blend” beans ever since.

I liked the flavour of these beans, but they were out of stock when I went to buy more beans yesterday, so I ended up picking up a pack of their seasonal, limited edition single origin (titled El peñón) beans from Nicaragua, which have pineapple, cocoa and blueberry undertones.

I’ve had a few cups of this new coffee and now realise I really like these “fruity” coffees, and would love to try some different options in the coming weeks, once I finish this bag.

Do you have any recommendations of fruity (whether aromatic, or taste, or both), or other amazing coffees that I should try? I feel like I’ve been missing out on a lot of great coffees out there by repeatedly purchasing the same Jamaica Blue beans.

As I’m located in Australia, it’d be great to either pick them up in store or buy online from somewhere that delivers to Australia and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.

Coffee,makestocksgreatagain,l3lohz,Filtering Pourover Coffee Twice,"Hi All,

Was recently at a local coffee shop and found their pourover method interesting. Basically, they filter their pourover coffee twice through the dripper. Letting it filter once and then again, pouring the coffee through the filter a second time. 

My theory on this is the method is for the masses and more error-proof. Obviously, it takes time and technique to properly pour filter coffee and not over/under extract the coffee. And by filtering twice, essentially that “error-proofs” the coffee flavors. The overly bitterness or acidity gets filtered out the second time. The trade off here is that the coffee does not have any prominent flavors thus resulting in a more light tasting coffee. Which I feel like is for the masses and generally people prefer lighter coffee. It also seems less time consuming as the barista doesn’t have to wait and pour. 

Thoughts? Is there some kind of science behind this?",1611439331

Coffee,Agentorange13813,l3jbje,Machine Died. Help!," 

Hello,

I'm relatively new to the coffee lifestyle and have run into a bit of an issue. My Keurig recently died and I am looking for some replacement options. Now I don't need anything too fancy, and I'd actually like to step away from using pods or k cups because I hate all the waste they produce. I'm the only coffee drinker in the household, so I don't need anything that can brew several cups at a time, although it's not awful if it includes a carafe. I've got pods left over, so if there is an option for pods that's cool, if not no biggie.

I need some suggestions from the coffee experts. I've done some research and feel like the Cuisinart SS10 and the Hamilton Beach Flex brew are kind of what I'm looking for. Anybody have experience with either of these or have something else to recommend?  Price point of around $100 US (a little more is fine) feels good.

Thanks in advance!",1611432428

A bit of background here:

\-Hario V60 dripper w/ brown hario tabbed filters

\-Baratza Encore (set to approx 16 on their scale)

\-Fellow Stagg EKG kettle

\-coffee set to 1:18 ratio approximately (18g coffee/240ml water)

5-6 minutes seems like a long time for the actual extraction. What could I be doing wrong here? The only things I can think of are possibly the coarseness of my grounds, or the filter themselves. Any other thoughts?

Coffee,PartyAtTheMoon-Tower,kqja2v,Having a strange phenomenon happening when I drink coffee out of a thermal vs. carafe. Would appreciate some insight!,"Okay, so last time I asked this I was downvoted to hell, but this seems to be a real phenomenon and I need to know if this is happening to anyone else. Basically: my coffee has been tasting great coming out of my thermals, but tastes like watery/ papery crud when drank at home. 

For example: I was working through this bag of Yellow Honey process from Boy and the Bear Coffee. My first two cups, drank at home, were really cruddy. Exactly as described above. Now, I've been out almost every day since Christmas, and since then that coffee has tasted so good. I get every note on the bag... just this bright, acidic/sweet passion fruit. I figured the small changes I made to my brew fixed the coffee.

Well, had a cup today, first time home in a few weeks... prepared it normally... and back to that watery/ papery/ dry taste. I was floored. 

The ONLY factor that changed was the thermal. Not only that, but I JUST got a new thermal. I had this issue with an old metal one, and thought the metal was doing weird things, but now I have a Frank Green ceramic lined thermal from Onyx. Which is supposed to keep the flavor of your coffee.

So I'm just so confused, but also feel somewhat hopeless. I thought my brews were starting to get consistent... I've had great cups of multiple coffees over the past few weeks... and suddenly they are tasting like crap at home.

Which makes me wonder if I was really tasting my coffee at all, and just making crappy brews the whole time. But... how is that possible? I know what I taste, and these have had very clear profiles. I've had some great cups.

Does anyone have any theories as to what could be happening? Why does keeping my coffee in a ceramic thermal for an hour seem to make this kind of difference?",1609798104

When I got into coffee, though, I found that most guides used metric units. It wasn't an issue for me as I just switched the units my kitchen scale used and started using grams for everything coffee and favoring weight over volume. 

I still use imperial measurements for most things, but when I'm in the kitchen, I start thinking in terms of liters, grams, and Celsius. This thinking is even bleeding into other parts of my kitchen routines. Instead of measuring powders in teaspoons and tablespoons, I use grams. Instead of making 16 ounces of coffee, I make half a liter of coffee.

Voice assistants and coffee calculator apps have been pretty helpful with this too as I'll often be looking at common imperial measurements and converting them to metric (or the nearest neat number).

Cup was super muddy but I kept the same coarseness when I went to grind for a drip later, and it still produced some fines.  The majority of the grind was medium coarse though, just to note.  So I made sure I was enough clicks out, and went down to the first click to then count my clicks again (but first I ground some coffee at the first click; idk why I did, I guess just to test out if it could go fine enough for espresso).  So I then went back to the same grind for my drip.  I ground just a few beans just to test and it looked good, but then when I dosed it for a full cup, it produced a ton of fines again.  Will this go away after a few grinds?  Are those fines just the fines that were left over from the previous grind and will they eventually be expelled?

Coffee,WingedBeing,kqby1r,Please critique the fuck out of my French press technique,"I thought I had this, and for a while I believe that I did even though I was technically doing everything wrong. Let me first start off by saying that the measurements within my French press are unequivocally wrong. The max line, which is marked as 8 cups? Yeah, that's actually 4. I only realized this a month after getting it, so I was dumping four cups of water onto what was essentially 16 tbs of medium ground coffee (yes, I know, we're getting to that). What I was getting was actually very strong coffee, no doubt due to the sheer quantity of coffee involved.

I recently came into the possession of a coffee grinder, so I said ""look out world, here comes some regulation French press coffee."" First, I realized that I had not eight, but four cups of water to deal with. So I calculated 8 tbs of coarse ground coffee. Here's how I do this:

1. Heat water to boiling in a sauce pan.

2. Measure 8 tbs of freshly ground coffee (coarse) and put in press.

3. After water is boiling, I take it off heat and let sit for 30 seconds.

4. I dump all of the water into the press and stir.

5. I put the lid on for four minutes, then press. Coffee is served.

Problem is, what I'm getting now is very weak. Yes, I should expect it to be weaker than when there were 16 tbs of finely ground coffee for 4 cups of water, but man...that actually tasted great! This tastes watery and thin.

What am I doing wrong here? Is it how I'm adding the water? Do I actually need a scale to measure in grams as I'm reading some people do? Is it as simple as just using more coffee?",1609777332

15g beans (ground to 5M on the Baratza Forte BG)

my recipe (v60) is:

* preheat/wet with hot tap water (typically I go to a full boil, 212 F on the Fellow EKG) 
* **0:00-0:45** \- 45g water in and a slight swirl to ensure infusion
* **0:45-1:15** \- additional 105g water in (150g total)
* **1:15-1:45** \- additional 100g water in (250g total), slightly swirl to knock attached grounds. 

I'm just wondering what is my ""next step"" in improving my pour over technique/results? I get decent results usually (maybe a little less fruity than I want sometimes, so I do tend to grind on occasion slightly finer to maybe around 5D). The other variable I haven't played with is water -- I am using city water -- but I don't know how much of a difference it makes + I would want some kind of sustainable way to modify my water source.

I’ve got a cheap French press from IKEA that I use for cold brew sometimes, but I still prefer hot coffee poured over ice.

I want to get into some higher quality coffee. Considering we have it twice a day we may as well enjoy it as much as possible. I’ve browsed around and seen some things about hand grinding, and different methods of brewing and was hoping to get a little input on a couple things.

I love the in-depth, sweet tones that come from cold brewing coffee, so I’m looking for a way to brew it that tones down the bitterness and really brings out the flavor, while still brewing hot so I’m not making separate types of coffee for the two of us.

I don’t mind the manual, more involved aspect of it, so I’d rather go with quality over convenience of use if that makes sense. I’d rather go with higher quality equipment and beans rather than entry level and go up from there.

As far as the coffee itself goes, it may be an oxymoron, but I’m looking for something that is a light-medium roast, that has that sweeter mocha flavor to it. Are there good online retailers for this, or is it better to find a local place to get it from?

Coffee,CreatureWarrior,l3bs5r,Should I learn to drink my coffee black?,"I used to use very cheap coffee and very low fat milk. Then I started experimenting with different coffees and found my favorite (Guatemalan coffee that has a slight chocolate flavor). It tasted a lot better and when I started using whole milk (someone told me to use it for coffee) and it tasted even better and actually enhanced the chocolate flavor. 

But only recently I've started to get more serious about coffee so I'm wondering if me using milk actually hides some flavors of the coffee. I find black coffee pretty bad, but I guess I could learn to drink it that way.

Should I keep looking or is there just too little difference after the beans have been roasted to heck and the milk is introduced?",1611381923
Coffee,OccamsRazorstrop,l35vwd,"[Question, long-winded] I’m confused","Until recently I’ve never lived in a home where the coffee was more than barely drinkable. Parents, spouse, even my own. Or a workplace. All of them used common supermarket or coffee service coffee and a Mr. Coffee style brewer (or the commercial version thereof). Even restaurant coffee was typically no better, though it got slightly better on occasion.

Then I had my first cup of Starbucks and my world was rocked, especially by the dark or robust roasts. But even the lighter roasts were *vastly* superior to everyday coffee.

Then I found Keurig and after trying a gazillion different pods, came up with coffee which, if not *quite* as good as Starbucks was pretty close. And which put what I’d been drinking up until then to shame. (Which? Green Mountain Dark Magic is my go-to; Emeril’s Big Easy Bold is my alternate. I like the intensity of the DM, but the BEB has a bit more flavor. A lot of the other pod flavors don’t seem that much better than what I’d been drinking, Donut Shop being a ubiquitous example.)

Due to medical reasons, I’m not supposed to have more than 2 cups per day and I probably average 1.5, just one some days, 2 on others (especially during the winter). So making a whole pot isn’t practical and the Keurig fits in well for that, too.

But reading around on the Web, I find that everyone seems to think that the Keurig makes crappy coffee and that you’re an environmental criminal and a spendthrift if you use one. I can handle the additional expense, and grit my teeth and bear the environmental bit, but the crappy coffee part comes as a shock.

I’ve watched a couple of the V60 videos and I really just want to make a quick cuppa joe and drink it, not conduct a science experiment or play with my coffee. And looking at Starbucks, it looks to me like they make their coffee just like all the places I’ve been getting crappy coffee before discovering them.

So should I just continue with my Keurig, with which I was entirely happy until I learned too much? Is it possible to get single-serving coffee that’s better than the Keurig without having to play with it (or pay hundreds of dollars for equipment and/or have a coffee machine as big as a Buick in my kitchen)? And based on what I’ve said that I like, even if I went there would I be likely to actually like it more?

I’m just confused how Starbucks can be so much better than all my prior pre-Starbucks experience and whether it can be replicated, or improved upon, at home on a single-serve basis in a way that will really work and not involve a lot of effort, money or space.

I’m sorry if this is a FAQ",1611378981

Coffee,kljshfdi,l321tx,Questions about getting a Hario V60 instead of my generic cone dripper,"I'm no stranger to decent coffee.  I've been making pour-over coffee and am generally happy with my results, but I'm wondering if I should mix it up for variety and try a Hario V60 to try to get more out of my specialty beans.

I currently use a no-name ceramic cone, like a Kalita Wave with the flat bottom and three holes, but using standard Melitta No. 2 bleached filters instead of wave filters.  The wet filters definitely stick to the sides of the cone despite the gentle grooves molded into the ceramic and drain slowly.  I have a gooseneck kettle and use a Baratza Virtuoso grinder.  I feel like even with the better burrs of the Virtuoso, I get quite a bit of fines and poor particle distribution.  The coffee drains well the first time I pour water over it, but then clogs for successive pours.  I've played with the grind size to eventually get a ~6 minute drain time, but the coffee is definitely brewing partially in immersive mode, almost like a Clever dripper.

I actually like the coffee I get well enough, but I'm wondering if it's time to experiment with a different cone and recipe to get more out of my beans.  Would getting a Hario V60 be a likely improvement?  Will the shape of that cone, its ribs, and its filters drain quickly, even given my uneven grind?  I know some people complain about the new tabbed Hario filters, but are they adequate and do they drain fast enough?  I'm not really looking to hunt for elusive filter paper as a new hobby.

Coffee,halcyen,l2zn5c,1zpresso Q2 fines issue,"Hi everybody!

I'm quite new to alternative brewing methods.

For v60 brewing decided to buy a good entry level manual grinder and got Q2 from aliexpress.

TL;DR:

1. The brand new Q2 grinder produces a lot of fines tested at marks 18-22 IMO. Is it defected?
2. The burrs doesn't seem to be perfectly aligned which is really noticeable at mark 1.
3. The total brewing time starting from blooming using 27-30g per 500ml varies from 4 to 6 minutes, the drawdown is usually quite long. Tried both Hoffman/Rao spin and no spin.
4. The coffee bed usually looks muddy with some extra mud layer on the side walls. And these amounts exclude the fines stuck to the grinder walls due to static, which varies.
5. The coffee roasted for filter brewing usually tastes quite bitter and unpleasant.
6. Is there a way to fix this issue by disassembly and trying to align burrs, or maybe the consistency may normalize as the burr wears out a bit?
7. Don't want to consider Kruve as solution due to highly controversial reviews and opinions, a cheap sieve from ali maybe.

[Coffee bed photos](https://imgur.com/a/zU78Qwp), the cracks may be due to touching filter after the brewing.

I chose Q2 cause it seems to be built better than Xeoleo and even Timemore's C2 which still has plastic parts and other issues discussed in this subreddit.

But to my regret Q2  turned out to be a disappointment due to quite large amounts of fines. I guess the burrs are not perfectly aligned though the shaft is ok (no wobbling while spinning on the handle).

The burr is blocked at mark 0 but at mark 1+- there is quite noticeable friction like 1/2 the way, no prominent rattle like with some Xeoleos but a distinct rustle.

I ejected burr and cleaned the grinder a few times, which haven't solved the issue yet. Haven't tried a deeper disassembly though.

I tested like 6 different beans by now, some produced more fines at 18-22, some less, but still enough to make coffee bed muddy and brewing long. The filters used are the original Hario v60 in a carton and the kettle is a gooseneck.

Please help or share your opinions on the issue, would be grateful.",1611357240

I just bought a Moccamaster for my family. Need an electric grinder to pair with.

The thing is my family loves Turkish coffee, therefore i need a grinder that can grind fine enough for turkish and moccamaster drip coffee.

Don’t wanna spend a lot like Niche.

The question is if I recalibrate the encore, is it fine enough for Turkish at 1-3 setting, and are there still range to play with the grind for moccamaster?

Would appreciate some photos, thank you",1611327592

Coffee,olivepepys,l2mbg1,Coffee newbie after some help,"Hi Everyone, 

I used to drink coffee every day growing up, grew out of it as a young adult but now would like ot get back into it, both for drinking coffee and for also a morning ritual. My parents have one of those all in one bean to cup machines, but they're hideously expensive and I've never been blow away by the coffee.  My auntie however has a drip through set up and the coffee is brilliant.  My partner knew i was looking into it so for my birthday last week bought me a V60 and a coffee subscription to Django.

I've started out with Hoffmans method (60:40 with a swirl) but just want some general tips on things I need to change or improve.  Making coffee is a bit like an experiment so I''ve been focussed on just getting the right technique rather than changing everything and having no clue what was good or bad.  Some info on what i do is below;

* 18g to 300ml water
* overall brew time just over 3 minutes
* water is straight from the kettle so probably high 90's temp wise

main issue i have with the technique is that Hoffman says to create a well and then wet the grind with water twice as much as the weight of the coffee, in this case 36g, then swirl to make sure they are completely wet.  this ratio doesn't seem to give me enough time to swirl before it passes through, is it ok to increase the water amount?  My understanding of this bloom phase is to get rid of the Co2 from the grounds before extraction, so it seems quite important?

I am also finding that the grinds keep getting swept up the side of the filter, I think this is because i have a normal kettle so the flow is a bit strong.  i push them back down into the slurry with a spoon, is this ok?  At the end of the extraction I have a nice flat bed but there is quite a bit of coffee stuck on the filter in the V60 channels, photo attached. Is this normal?

other general bits that i could do with some help on are;

* grind - the coffee comes pre ground, i've attached a photo of the grind to get help on whether this is coarse/fine and even.  It also says it was ground in November, whilst this isn't freshly ground, does it class as old??  I can change the subscription to beans but can someone then recommend a decent manual grinder (budget is £50-100)
* Water - i use tap water but live in a soft water area, should i really use filtered?
* Coffee - is there a good standard coffee (UK) everyone knows that would be a good baseline for me to start with?  i don't know if the coffee i have is good or not

I'm new to all this and just trying to get better, the cups i've produced this week have been better and more consistent than last week.  I'm just looking to see what the limiting factors are in my current set up/method and what things i should/could change to get better returns

I also read the post about pour over tips for beginners and not to complicate it.  Interestingly, i don't find the hoffman method particularly complicated.  It was a bit overwhelming coming in here to see people talking about various ratios, temperatures and techniques, but once you read into it more it's generally quite straight forward.  i went through Hoffmans video and just noted 8 steps to follow, if you work out the weight of both water and coffee before hand it's quite simple and easily repeatable.  Admittedly, I do have a background in labwork, which does help quite a bit.

Anyway, apologies for the lengthy post, just trying to give everyone the detail and i'm interested to learn more and get better at this.",1611316868

Since the difference between a preground coffee and a freshly ground one is huge, I decided to buy a grinder as well. Since my machine uses a pressurized basket, I know that the consistency of my grind will not matter that much, as it does in machines with non-pressurized baskets. My budget is around 50 Euros. From what I read, I should invest in a hand grinder rather than an electronic burr grinder like Delonghi KG89 or something else in the same price range. As a hand grinder my options so far seem like: Hario Slim Plus Mini, Hario Sketron Plus, Timemore C2 (even though it is a little bit off my budget) What would you recommend to me buy?

p.s. I also occasionally brew coffee with a french press, but I hope that every hand grinder could grind that course. So I did not mention it above :)",1611308132

Recently bought a Gaggia espresso machine. I have been putting 12g of coffee. But I am not quite sure when should I stop the extraction process. Someone told me its 20 seconds and another person told me stop extraction when the extraction stats loosing color and looks watery. 

How many ml of coffee should be extracted per gram of coffee? For instance how many ml should be extracted for 12 ? 

Also. I usually let the handle stay in the machine for a minute or so before taking it off (that's what the instructor suggested me). However I noticed that, while I try to remove the handle, the pressure isn't released yet and it throws the handle downwards. I hope I explained this well.

Coffee,polygonfuture,l137sm,Coava Kilenso + Moka Pot = acidic at first. Bitter at end. Heeelp,"Hi wonderful r/Coffee community.

I am using a Bialetti Moka pot for the first time ever.  I've made a few batches but not quite getting a good flavor.  I'm in need of some advice.

These are the details of my setup:

&amp;#x200B;

* 3 Cup Moka Pot
* Coava Kilenso in espresso roast
* \~Somewhere between 24-27 grams of coffee in basket
* No tamping / just leveling by tapping sides

&amp;#x200B;

My process:

1. Grind somewhere between 24-27 grams of coffee. Consistency is courser than table salt.  Maybe double the size (0.6mm - 1mm in size?)
2. Pre-boil water in kettle and fill below safety valve.
3. Place grounds basket in, screw together and place on medium low heat.
4. Takes maybe a minute or two before coffee starts coming out of top.
5. When coffee starts to bubble pull it off and run under cold water.
6. When I open the pot, the grounds are somewhat damp (not dry, not a puddle though)
7. There's maybe half an inch of water still left in the bottom of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

The result is a coffee that is murky (similar to french press).  There's a bit of acidic / sour notes at first (because of kilenso?), but it ends bitter.      


Does this sound about right?   Anyone have suggestions on how I could reduce the bitterness at the end?",1611122826

Upgraded to a Technivorm Moccamaster after my Bonavita's life ended after a solid seven years and use a Baratza Encore for grinding.  I primarily use the MM for my daily coffee intake, but also enjoy a pour-over or Aeropress when the mood hits. All products used are descaled and cleaned properly and as recommended. 

For years, I have been consuming Jose's coffee (from Costco), mainly the French Roast , and have really enjoyed it. However, with my new MM, I wanted to get back into fresh coffee again. I've tried two different types of fresh roasted coffee from two different roasters and I feel like I'm missing something. One was a South America blend, the other was a Kenyan single origin. I've drank both black with no cream or sugar or any additives and though I have enjoyed them, I don't get the flavors or hints of flavors expected. They both are vibrant and taste great, but I don't taste much of a difference between the two. They both just taste like better black coffee than before. 

I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I went through the South American blend in about a week through a pour-over and MM and didn't notice much of a difference. I see all the posts here about the flavors tasted on fresh coffee and I just am not getting that on my end. I've got the MM and Encore dialed in for coffee:water and grind size, so I know it's not that. I doubt it's my palette too.

Coffee,shamelessness9001,l0q2w6,[Gross Warning] Roaches living in my Keurig,"I found some roaches on my Keurig cup after opening it a few weeks back. I was disgusted and quickly squashed them and looked all over the Keurig for any others. After inspecting and not seeing more, I thought that was that. Today, I went to my Keurig to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and as I opened it a couple of small roaches scurried out. I’m horrified. I’ve realized that these pests are LIVING in my keurig. In all those little nooks and crannies of it. Apparently, they like the warmth and wetness of it. I didn’t think it was possible for the roaches to survive in there but apparently it’s home sweet home for them after researching this online for the past hour (why isn’t it designed to prevent this???). Anyways, I’m disgusted.

Is the keurig salvageable or should I throw it out? I loved the convenience that the Keurig provided. I would just fill up a reusable cup with some grounds, pop it into the keurig, push a button and have coffee ready in a minute. I’d really like to continue making coffee this way and I’m really not a coffee snob so I don’t mind that it’s not as good as something made from a French press or whatever other methods there are out there. Should I give up on the Keurig life and if not how can I make sure that I’m not having the same disgusting issue if I buy another machine?

Coffee,NachoFailconi,l0pugg,What should I expect from coffee beans' characteristics?,"Hi! I'd like to understand a little bit more about coffee beans, since it is the only part that I've been ""ignoring"" from my brewing process.

For context, currently I use three methods to brew my coffee: a [Hario ceramic v60-02](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/drippers/products/v60-ceramic-coffee-dripper-02-classic), a [six-cup Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/six-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html) and a [three-cup Bialetti Moka Express](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/coffee-makers/moka/moka-express-nera.html). I grind my coffee with a [Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/grinders/products/ceramic-coffee-mill-skerton-plus) and, believe it or not, I found a setting that grinds just fine for the three methods. I use filtered water through a Brita filter, and for the pour-overs I use the 60 g per liter of water ratio.

Not long ago I started buying in roaster stores that roast coffee once an order is put. And it is here where I have my doubts: what should I expect from coffee beans' characteristics, such as country, height, type of roasting and others? Which characteristics ""better"" suit my brewing methods? What other things should I take into account at the time of choosing beans?

To clarify, I'm not disappointed in my brewing. I love it! Usually I buy Colombian and Nicaraguan coffees. But I'd like to know more.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JBQZPX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_H3VbGbPTYQZKN

So I bought a gooseneck kettle for Espresso with my Flair. I didn't really want to spend the $150 on the Stagg, so I went with the Miroco gooseneck kettle instead for $75. Ultimately I did end up returning it and getting a Stagg EKG, but I wanted to talk about the Miroco a bit.

Obviously, the Miroco is a knockoff of the Stagg. Extremely similar design, identical spout, same base connection mechanism.

Between the two kettles, these are the things that are the same: base connector, spout, internal heating chamber is ALMOST identical, the heating plate and thermocouple are the exact same except rotated 180° from one another, even down to the gap at the bottom.

The single thing that made me realize that these kettles are likely made in the same factory or with some of the same tooling is the switches on the back for holding temp and switching to C/F. These switches are pretty crappy, and I was a bit disappointed to see them on the Stagg because it would've been so easy to use a simple rocker switch that would feel magnitudes better, but they didn't. And the Miroco kettle has the EXACT same crappy slider switches.

Now, all that being said, the one thing in my mind that the Stagg has over the Miroco kettle is that it holds temperature much better and might tighter to the set point.  I think the Stagg is both checking the temp more frequently and is a more robust software loop. The Stagg holds within 1° F, whereas the Miroco will drop up to 3° on the readout, but the thermometer is inaccurate by up to 5°, pretty sloppy.

So with all of that being said, if you don't need a super accurate temperature control, for something like espresso, I could absolutely recommend the Miroco kettle as a much cheaper option to the Stagg.

Also, for what it's worth, the Miroco has fantastic customer support. I emailed them about the inaccurate thermometer just asking if there was a way to calibrate it, and they, unprompted, sent another one my way and a return shipment label for the first kettle.",1611070965

Coffee,Darkslayerqc,l0kjbm,Espresso guy trying V60 for the first time : This is disapointing,"Hey all, 

As the title says, I've been an espresso drinker forever. Recently I got a V60 for christmas but had to wait a bit for the friggin gooseneck kettle to get here. After a couple tries, I'm really starting to wonder that the hell is the big fuss. From what I've read and watched online, I could get different, interesting, fruity flavor profiles from my beans that could be different than when brewed as espresso. Right now all I taste is weak ""brown water"" coffee comparable to what you get at convenience stores. I mean, is that it ? is it just a glorified trendy way to hand make percolator coffee ?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my recipe/process : 

20g in yirgacheffe, about a month off roast, light roast, freshly ground to slighly coarser than espresso but  would'nt call it ""coarse"". Classic ceramic V60 with the japan made filters than comes in a box of 40.   

Shake the grounds flat, make a hole with a spoon. 30-40 ish seconds bloom with 40g of water, straight off the boil (remember I'm using a light roast)

then concentric pour up to about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes. I'm not stressing the total pour time to get to 2 minutes as I feel more heat retention and less variation must be good for a light roast. Then stir clockwise with a spoon, complete drawdown achieved in about 2:30 minutes. 

And when I taste it, I wish I'd make an espresso. I mean, there might be stuff to tweak and I have yet to try the 4:6 method, but I doubt it will ever be that better than ""office coffee"".",1611065420
Coffee,fosterthepensioners,l0kg2u,Cold brew or nitro brew setup?,"Hi everyone, I'm looking to sell cold coffee this coming Spring and Summer and want to know from your experience what's best in terms of prep, margins, taste and popularity? I have a tricycle that I'd happily convert, but to buy a kegerator for nitro brew would cost the best part of £1,500 and the kegs don't offer much margin in the UK. (£4/Litre to buy) + cups and straws etc. But I guess nitro brew tends to sell for more than hot espresso coffees, right? So maybe I'm wrong. It's not that popular or trendy in the UK yet.
Cold brew can be prepped at home, but obviously it'll be a trial and error process, and the prep time to steep and filter the batches could eat up a lot of my time, with no need to clean the equipment because it'll all be bottled for resale.

What do you think? I'm learning towards cold brew because I can make it more personalised, but then nothing looks as cool as a nitro brew pump on a sunny day! And ultimately NBC would be way more efficient, all things considered.

Recently I started using a WDT tool to distribute the grounds in my shots instead of just using my hand on the top, and recently all of my shots have been overwhelmingly sour ever since I started using it, I have not tried to pull a shot without using the tool to see if it is the culprit because I've wasted enough beans.

I wanted to know people's thoughts on their favorite distribution techniques and what has worked/works for them. Also, I would like to get thoughts on this video because I know lots of people love to use the OCD tool/things like it. For people that don't feel like watching the stats are as follows:

**Tapping -**

* 18 Grams In
* 35.8 Grams Out
* 9.51 TDS = 18.91% (extraction)

**WDT/Paperclip-**

* 18 Grams In
* 36.9 Grams Out
* 8.03 TDS = 16.46%

**OCD Tool -**

* 18 Grams In
* 36.4 Grams Out
* 7.67 TDS = 15.51%

As you can see the tapping method (literally grinding into the portafilter and tapping on a table) seems to give the best extraction out of the 3 and I believe could be a culprit of my sour (under-extracted) shots. Let me know what you all think, have a great day!",1611064505

Coffee,cafe_beginner,l0f6c2,"Hi, i need some advice on setting up my batch brewer.","Hi, i run a small cafe in S.Korea.

Recently I bought a used coffee machine from Grindmaster. 

 I was hoping this machine would do elaborate extraction, but I found it difficult to program elaborate extraction because it was an outdated model. 

it only provides a maximum of six pulses. so ,pulse brewing cannot be applied during the entire brew time 

i can set the time of each pulse and brewing time.

it flows 0.8oz per sec. if i set the pulse on time 10 sec it flows water 8 oz.

and if i set the pulse off time 10 sec, it stop injecting water 10 sec.

 So, the off time is added to the time I set, and it becomes the total extraction time. 

for example,  If I apply 90 seconds extraction time and six pulses to extract 2 liters, and set the on/off time of each pulse to 10 seconds, the total extraction time is about 3 minutes or so. ( Uses 125 grams of beans )

My concern is, isn't 3 minutes too short to proceed with 2 liters of extraction?   
I want to lengthen the brewing time for proper extraction, but I want to know how to do it wisely.  

I am afraid that if I shorten the water injection time and lengthen the stop time, the coffee taste will be negative. 

How about diluting after a small amount of extraction through the bypass function? 

In Korea, batch brew is not popular and it is difficult to obtain information.

 Hope you give me a lot of advice. i really need help.

Coffee,pydevo,l0a5hy,Exploring Coffee Options,"A bit about me: I've never made my own coffee (unless Nescafe instant coffee counts). I regularly get coffee from a local cafe and my go-to drink is an Iced Caramel Macchiato. However, it's getting too expensive and I'd also like to cut down on sugar so I'm looking at other options. I don't know if it's just placebo but iced coffee is also easier on my gut compared to anything hot so I try to stick with that. I recently tried Cafila Farms XX Espresso, and I liked it but not sure if it's best to continue for longterm.  
Other alternative seem to be to brew my own coffee and just customize how ever I want with syrups, etc. From what I understand reading through threads:

1) Since I have a &lt;$100 budget, an Espresso machine is out of the question  
2) I could make an almost espresso using a Moka Pot  
3) I could get a french press or Aeropress and brew my own coffee

I feel like the consensus is to avoid a drip machine so I'm not listing that. Also, most of what I've found is for hot coffee (what it's supposed to be). Considering I'll be making iced coffee and adding some milk and syrup to it, I'm not sure what the best option for me would be. 

It also feels a little scary diving into something I have no idea about but after reading a lot of posts here, I feel like learning to make my own coffee would definitely be worth it and go well with my morning ritual. :) I'm open to all thoughts and recommendations!",1611023659
Coffee,WhippedMale,l09zty,V60 - 4:6 Method/General pourover questions,"Hoping to get some insight from those who've tried the 4:6 method (or any other methods that worked for them). Quick bit of background (using hario v60 #2 plastic):

&amp;#x200B;

* Pourover Method: v60 4:6 ratio (#1 50ml, #2 70ml, #3/4/5 60ml) 45s between the pours
* Coffee Beans: Two Bears COLOMBIA INZÁ CAUCA (Roasted on December 29th 2020)
* Grinder/Size: Niche Zero - I'd say medium coarse. I'm past the 50 point, more towards the center of the rear hinge for those that know what it looks like. 
* Kettle/Temperature: EKG Electric kettle by Fellows @ 100c, I first rinse my filter by the time I'm actually using the water it's cooled down to around 96c. 
* Amount &amp; Ratio: 20g/300ml (1:15) 
* Tasting/feel notes: Acidic but not terribly sour almost pleasant, definitely a sour smell but nothing revolting &amp; a little thin almost tea like

While I do enjoy making cups of coffee I only have so many times in a day I can make myself a cup. I limit myself to two 300ml ""cups"". I've tried the method above 3 times now. I'm looking for suggestions to those that have made and ""perfected - to their own liking"" this method (or others). 

My goal is to have a more balanced cup and a slightly more rich mouth feel. While my current results are definitely drinkable, they aren't to my liking.  I'd like to move away from the acidity a little bit (not so much as to remove it completely) and would like to have a little more...texture (I don't think that's the correct word here). It just feels a little thin.

Also any other methods where individuals have achieved a similar taste profile to what I'm looking for would be great. Also as an aside, what are people referring to when they say their coffee has ""sweetness"" because so far I haven't been able to discern any noticeable sweetness from my cups.

I bought it knowing it's probably not in good shape, which is kind of true. However the machine is mostly functional.. Grinding and tamping works, Steam boiler works, Espresso Boiler also works, but the machine was quite dirty. I did a couple of back flushes, but it still looked full of old coffee, so I ran it through a clean cycle with a Cafiza Pill (essentially just multiple rounds of back flushing).
Unfortunately the screw holding the shower screen ended up breaking during the clean cycle. it seems to be somewhat standard, and I might even be able to buy an original one, but they're currently out of stock.
The bigger problem though is that I don't know if it's possible to get the broken screw out of where it broke. I don't know what this plastic part between the boiler and the portafilter is. I can probably take it apart, but I thought I'd ask for advice first, maybe someone can point in a specific direction?

Once upon a time, I bought a GE electric coffee percolator from the 60s (give or take 10 years). It had an adjustment on it for strength, which as far as I ciuld tell was an adjustment for brew time. i gav eit to a friend long ago. Anyway, now that I'm working from home, I want to get another one. I know some people dislike them, but I loved the coffee I made with it.

What did the brew strength adjustment actually do? I always had it turned to maximum or pretty close.

I'd rather buy new because I have food allergies and celiac, so I generally buy kitchen items new. I haven't seen any electric percolators that have any kind of adjustment on them. Is this feature not available anymore? I would hate to buy one and then find out it makes tragically weak coffee. 

If need be, I'll get a stovetop perc, but I would prefer electric for the keep-warm feature - if it only keeps it warm for an hour or so. Yes, I know a keep-warm feature heresy to some, but it's how I like it.",1611266905

Coffee,kitkat6199,l23llc,Breville Bambino Plus Users: Consistently Under-Extracted Shots?,"Hello coffee community! 

After much agonizing over which Breville machine to get, I ended up going with the Breville Bambino Plus. The convenience of the automatic milk steaming and the quick heat-up ultimately won me over. I got the Capresso Infinity grinder to go with it. I realize these aren't top-of-the-line models, but the ease of use and price range made them seemingly my best options. 

I busted it out today and started trying to use it, but I am consistently getting under-extracted shots. I have no idea where I'm going wrong. I started in the ""fine"" range on my Capresso grinder and then tried using the lower end of the ""extra fine""; I tried using more espresso grounds and packing it more tightly/using more pressure. But still my espresso streams out too quickly. 

This is my first machine using dual-walled baskets instead of single-walled baskets so perhaps that's why I'm noticing the difference? I'm an espresso amateur for the most part, but have made it at home for years (previously used a Gaggia and then the Breville Infuser). Maybe I need to invest in a better grinder?

Coffee,Che_galego,l1xyon,Clever Dripper - I'm not finding the flavours I was expecting,"Hi everyone, nice to meet you, first post in here. I've been following this subreddit and the coffee world for the last 3-4 months. Saved a couple of bucks and recently bought a wilfa uniform grinder, a clever dripper and a gooseneck kettle for my first setup.

The first two coffee beans that I bought were Ethiopian (Guji, natural) and Colombian (Cauca, fully washed) both tagged as ""Filter Roast"" and they look light-medium roasted.  
Due to covid the Clever Dripper had a delay on the delivery... and since I was excited to start using the grinder and the beans, I borrowed a cheap espresso machine (old delonghi icona) from my gf parents. I've pulled some shots during the week and I really enjoyed the Ethiopian beans acidic and floral? notes, it was really different from what I was used to from capsules espresso\\instant coffee\\wtv. The Colombian's were ok but didnt have that unexpected taste.   


That been said, I was looking forward to have that taste on a bigger cup with the clever dripper, obviously not the same intensity but at least some things that I enjoyed (especially the acidicy).  
During this week I've been using the Clever, 60-65g - 1L  with 2-3min brew (I follow the Hoffmann way of doing it) and writing down every thing. The problem is... I dont get much of a flavour or acidicy from any of the beans :(, I'm even getting a tastier cup from the Colombian's tbf.   
After trying a lot of different grind sizes and not getting any distint characteristics from the each coffee, I've even done two cups of the same beans, one with really course grounds (34 on the wilfa for the ones who have it) and one with really fine grounds (14) to see in which grind should I aim for... The courser was kinda meh and watery, the finer at least had some harsness to it lol but not what I wanted.

Do I have unreallistic expectations on the flavours I should be able to get on my Clever Dripper from the espresso experience?   
Are the flavours on the Clever that subtle? Because I was able to perflectly differenciate each bean and its characteristics on the espresso shots.",1611233949

I’m about to pick up a half caff and see how it goes. 

So I’m curious how tolerance is effecting the effect of the caffeine on me and how can it be manipulated? Say I want to avoid that caffeine crash and increase my tolerance, would my tolerance be back to normal if I just deal with the effects of too much caffeine until it’s bearable again? Or would you recommend slowly increasing my intake by starting with one cup of tea, up to two cups, up to multiple cups a day, up to espresso, up to coffee?

I realise that I might as well have my perfect cup but I'll never really be settled. Unfortunately, I do not have the financial resources right now to go buy an Espresso Machine. That'll remain a desire until a year or two at least. But at the same time, I am excited that one day I'll get my hands on an Espresso Machine and I'll try stuff out myself.

While still being somewhat new to high quality equipment when it comes to brewing, my cup today had a weird vegital, almost grass-like note, apart from that it was the best grind setting I""ve found for theese beans. Grinding even a little  coarser felt underextracted to me,  it was sour, and hollow (and countrary to what everyone says. it was still suprisingly bitter after the overwhelming sourness). Grinding coarser didn't help either. There are some questions rising in me, mainly the quality of the roast (Its a medium-light roast IMO, for filter, and a reknown brand here, in Hungary. Oh, and the beans are from Burundi). Could this indicate a faulty roast, or is it a faulty technique? If the latter, how do I correct it? Where to go in terms of grind size from here?

While I like the aftertaste, I find the acidity a little too distracting so for future brews, what are the indicators of a balanced cup? I’ve left some info for my parameters down below.

Coffee: Hunda Oli Ethiopia from ManCoCo, Wholebean

Grinder: 1Zpresso JX, setting 24 (72 clicks via 2 rotations and 12 clicks if that helps). At 28 it’s pure homemade lemonade. At 20 it’s too bitter for me.

Hario v60 in glass, plastic and ceramic as well as switch variation, Kadou m1 starman by hasami, kalita waves and trapezoids, cafecs flower dripper, timemore's crystal eyes, origami drippers. 

Brewing a dark roast comes down to separating the grind size and brew time. ( grinding coarser yet brewing longer) unlike lighter roasts where grinding finer and pushing for faster speeds seems to be quite the trend.

Coffee,Jonny_Panino,l1a3vg,Please Suggest the Best Setup for Me,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent the last week throwing myself into the rabbit hole of coffee. I've researched plenty, trying to understand what I like and what I don't, what my needs are and how I can meet them. I've read plenty on the grinder side of things, and I know that a reasonable entry-level choice for my needs could be around £200-£250. However, I'm a bit at a loss when it comes to choosing the right machine without breaking the bank (ideally I'd spend around as much as the grinder).

How I envision coffee as a hobby for myself (and this is very personal!) will affect the setup that is right for me, so I will write it down here and hopefully it'll help tailor your suggestions.

**Things I want to do** with this hobby: 

\- try different beans and understand the different flavours

\- make nice (emphasis on nice, not necessarily world-class..) espressos and milky drinks (from cortados to lattes), these really are the only drinks I care about. 

\- to a certain extent, learn new skills. For example, trying to apply different brew pressures or different grind settings, different doses, etc (please forgive me if I don't speak the lingo yet). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I do NOT want to do** as I would not find enjoyable (and again, this is personal, you might love this stuff): 

\- spending many minutes prepping the equipment. Waiting time is OK, but I can't afford to be assembling things, grinding manually, warming things up, cleaning 100 different bits and bobs. (eg I've seen some manual machines like the Flair and I am not much into the idea of doing all of that assembly with many pieces. I like the concept of applying pressure manually though as it's part of ""learning a new skill"" as described above)

\- be too worried about brewing the 100% perfect  cup every single day. Yes, maybe in the future I'll get addicted and I will want to be extremely anal about every single detail, but for now I don't see myself e.g. weighing every single day the ""liquid output"" (again, sorry for not speaking the lingo) to make sure I follow some specific ratio, or worrying that I have 19.5g ground coffee in the basket instead of 19g. Yes I can do it sometimes if I feel like it, and especially if it's the weekend, but on weekdays I would probably like to ballpark my coffee prep most of the times and enjoy a good cup without worrying about the minuscule details. Being geeky is nice and appealing, I love numbers and I see myself doing it but not full time, it must be on my own terms. 

So in general I want to experiment and I do want to learn and try new things, but I don't want it to be 100% science, and I know that if there's too much prepping, cleaning &amp; measuring involved I risk not having enough patience to keep at it in the long term (especially the prepping - for some it's a ritual, for me it's a chore). I don't know if I'm explaining myself clearly. 

In case you were thinking of suggesting it, I don't like moka coffee (and as an Italian I don't feel snobby/elitist saying that espresso is a different drink). I would mostly make coffee for myself and possibly my girlfriend (but she doesn't drink espresso). I'm pretty sure that if I didn't have the requirement of wanting to make good espresso, my life would be much simpler.

Coffee,Molasar,l19wz8,Bonavita Water Level Lines and Brew Ratio,"Confused about Bonavita water tank level marks. We make a full put with our 8-cup 1901TS. I know they use 5 ounces as a cup, so 8 cups would theoretically yield 40 oz of coffee. However, when you fill the water tank to the ""Max"" 8-cup mark, it's much more than 40 ounces of water.

So is the Bonavita just accounting for water lost through evaporation from the heating? Or is it just inaccurate?

We've been filling to the max line and using 66 g of beans, which would be a 1:17 ratio for 40 oz of water. The coffee tastes good, but I'm curious how everyone else is dealing with this and interpreting the brew ratio witht hese machines.

Do I calculate my coffee to water ratio based on the amount of water in the tank, or the amount of coffee yielded?",1611151908
Coffee,SomebodyInACity,l19vyj,"It's cliché, but having good coffee truly does make a difference!","I really did not like coffee all that much, I thought it was too bitter, too musty, etc.  
Then i fell down the rabbithole.

I got curious, bought a cheap handgrinder, got REALLY frustrated, decided coffee wasn't for me at all  
got curious again, got a comandante c40 which improved things DRAMATICALLY, but still stuck to the beans I was using at the time, which were some supermarket lavazza beans. Now, they were noticably better than everything I was used to, but when I started making pourovers I really, really ran face first into all the problems with them. My philosophy behind sticking with the bad beans is that I could have something to practise technique with, and if I could learn how to make the supermarket beans taste good, I could probably make amazing coffee with good beans. 

However, at a certain point there wasn't anything I could do to make things taste any better. I'd gotten some pretty ok coffee out of it in the beginning, when I was still clumsy with pouring and making underextracted brews. It made weak coffee with a nice strong caramel/cream scent that I liked a lot. When I got better at it and my extraction went up, the coffee got worse and worse. It still had the same lovely fragrance that I loved, but it just started tasting of cardboard. I decided to investigate, I brewed at a lot of different grind settings, and apart from it getting weaker and more hollow at coarser settings and more musty and cardboardy to bitter at finer settings.

In hindsight, it's pretty obvious. I recently ordered some good coffee beans from a local roastery, and the difference is clear as day. I compared what I could see, I smelled the beans and even ate a coffee bean or 2. Some things I learned from that:

1. Beans should smell and taste good and aromatic, not like dirt and cardboard
2. There shouldn't be broken beans in the bag
3. A good grind doesn't improve your coffee, it only gives you clarity on it's quality.

When I brewed with the new coffee I got, I had some coffee from Panama, even though it acted way different because of the lighter roast, and I didn't get the grind down perfectly first try, i could taste SO much, way more than I could ever dream of with the other beans. If you got a good grinder, you shouldn't have to fight for at least an okay tasting cup of coffee. The coffee i got was much more closer to tea than I ever imagined coffee could be. It had this earl-grey like quality both in astringency and presence of this bergamot taste, citrussy and herb-like, with notes of thyme rising up to my nose after I took a sip. Far better than having a hit of nice roasty sweetness followed by glue and paper and phenolic notes.

Having a good grinder is absolutely key, but having good coffee is most certainly not to be underestimated either. I'm having a lot of fun with it, it makes the brewing into a much more culinary experience. I don't think i could ever go back. Thanks to the community for answering my questions and teaching me about this interesting world!

But what would happen if you heated up the milk and simply used *that* to steep the coffee and press through it?

My thoughts are that fat-soluble compounds in coffee are more difficult to extract than water-soluble compounds because, well, water is polar and fat isn't. They don't attract and fat won't dissolve in water.

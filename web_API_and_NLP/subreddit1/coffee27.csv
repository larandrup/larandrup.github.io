Coffee,ColoTransplant,kx9q76,New Jura S8 and hubby has become a coffee bean snob,"We gave each other the S8 for Christmas and are really enjoying it.  However, my hubby has become a real bean snob.  He has thrown away several bags already.  I am trying to find some new options for him.  I do know the general area I am looking in:

&gt; he likes the fruity notes of African coffee especially Ethiopian 

&gt; he likes a light roast

&gt; I know I need to order it so that it is a week old when he puts it in the machine

I need to find something soon so I can order for our anniversary next week.  I am in SoCal but the world is my option if they ship.

Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.",1610643833

Coffee,CoffeeHax17,kx9dlj,Flash brewing is the way,"I hate hot coffee and I always have to wait till the coffee cools down a little bit. Then again if I wait too long, coffee starts tasting horrible. So what I discovered today is flash brewing. It's basically pour over on ice. Coffee cools down immediately and the taste is not spoiled at all. I tried it today and I'm amazed. Coffee was as flavourful as normal pour over coffee is and it's exactly the temperature I want it to be. If it was summer, I would add ice cubes and make it iced. 

So that's about it, I wanted to share my experience with flash brewing. Now it's my goto way for coffee.",1610642831
Coffee,GodlessGayGuy,kx8pgo,Bialetti Brikka vs. Ariete Vintage Filter/Drip Coffee Machine,"So I currently have a Bialetti Brikka (4 cup) and I'm not really interested in investing in an espresso machine.

I am however interested in possibly trying the Ariete Vintage Coffee Machine.

So for those who know both types (moka pot vs. Drip Coffee) which is better? Assuming I buy fresh beans and grind them appropriately for both methods?

Is Drip Coffee really bad no matter what? Or are some machines pretty similar to what a Moka Pot accomplishes?",1610640861
Coffee,thomasthtc,kx8ovx,"Single origin for filter, blend for espresso is the norm?","(Hi it's my first post here so please forgive me if this is discussed before)

I have started drinking coffee, mainly milk coffee a few years ago. I started joining the field of filter coffee (mainly hand drip) last year. I noticed one thing I can't really find an answer on.

""Why is there very few blend coffees beans for filter brewing?""

There are both blend and single origin coffee for espresso brewing, though a majority of coffee shops serve blend for espresso-based drinks. What I understand is that most shops look for a balanced flavour in espresso, so they would blend 2-4 different beans (both origin and variety) into an espresso blend. But quite some coffee shops serve SOE as well. In-fact, the best espresso-based coffee I tasted is made with Hatch's El Paraiso 720hour fermentation Geisha. 

But this is not the case in filter brewing. The trend seems to be: Filter coffee is a better way to showcase what the best coffee beans can taste, so there is little point blending different beans. On the other hand, will blend coffee beans actually give a boost to some inferior beans to give a more complex flavour in filter brewing as well? I know a few foreign coffee shops sell blend coffee beans for filter brewing, but little or none is doing that in Hong Kong? Is there anything I overlooked? 

Thanks in advance :)",1610640813

Coffee,BigBlueHawk,kx8gpl,Trying to find a new brewing method but can't make decisions,"I've been researching coffee brewing methods for well over a month now because I can't make decisions. I recently moved out, and where previously I would just grab a cup or two from the family coffee pot of Maxwell House, but I'm now the only regular coffee drinker in my new place. Maybe 2 mugs a day, max, so I don't need a whole 12-cup drip machine. My roommate has a Keurig with the ""use your own"" coffee thingy, but I find Keurig coffee plastic-y to my taste.

So... I don't know what the hell to do. I *was* gonna use my Espro travel press, but after two days I remembered why I stopped using it because it's a massive pain to clean. It felt like I was spending more time cleaning then drinking coffee it. And as much as I'm all about a very good cup of coffee, a V60 sounds like something I'd have to concentrate on. I can barely walk in the morning, let alone carefully pour out things to specific grams or whatever. Probably shouldn't even trust myself with pouring boiling water, honestly. Plus I'd probably need to replace my kettle and get scales. But then ""push button, get coffee"" simplicity gets me back to Keurig, which I'm not satisfied with.

I'm now realizing I'm basically asking for the impossible best-of-all-worlds: a quick, low effort, low maintenance way to make 1-2 mugs of quality coffee. Does anyone have any suggestions? Aeropress seems to be the closest to what I'm looking for, but for some reason I'm hesitant on it. Or maybe chemex. Or a Hario Switch? Clever Dripper? Just a V60 and being lazy with no gooseneck or scale? Some sort of quality low-capacity auto drip machine I've never heard of? Decision making is hard, and I'm clearly overthinking this. I'm losing sleep over this.",1610640135

Coffee,heklin0,kx8dq2,Story Time: Starbucks vs Single Origin Craft,"I hope stories are allowed here. Haven't seen many, but don't see it in the rules not to. TLDR at bottom. 


A bit of backstory first. We had just moved homes into a bug infested apartment. While we dealt with that, I took my espresso machine to work to protect it. (We left the apt, sued, won a lot of money, for those that are curious).


I am known as the coffee guy at work. There are a handful of folks that I will make drinks for when I'm not busy. 2 of them are good work friends. There's Jack who loves trying new things and while he doesn't want to spend his life on coffee, he's always asking questions and wanting to try new coffees I get. Then there's Chas. She just recently got a Moka Pot and I'm so proud of her...unfortunately this story was two years ago and she was far from today. Here we go. 


I invited Jack and Chas to my office to try some espresso. They had just made a Starbucks run, but they wanted some anyways. I was happy to oblige since they'd be able to compare Starbuck to real coffee. At this point, Jack has finished his drink but Chas brought hers with her. 


I begin getting the shots prepped and ready to be pulled while explaining what I'm doing and how espressos are made. Jack asks questions, Chas watches and listens. 


Drinks are made. They're just straight espresso since I didn't have any milk at work. I try mine. It's good. Jack tries his. He really likes it and starts trying to figure out notes. Chas.....pours it into her Starbucks drink. 


I'll wait a few seconds to let you mull that over. 


She poured my beautiful craft espresso.... into her iced coffee from Starbucks. 


I just stare. Jack, thank goodness for Jack, says ""Chas, what the hell did you just do?"" 


Chas, not starring at her cup in shock: I- I don't know why I just did that. Why did I-....


She looks up at me, me still in silence: I'm so sorry! I don't know what just happened. I- Do you want me to leave? 


Me: No, it's fine. Your drink was almost empty anyways. Maybe you'll be able to taste it. 


Jack starts asking me questions while I start cleaning up. It's kind of awkward for a bit. They leave. 


I still invite them for coffee, but Chas never shows up. Early last year. Jack was OOO, and I invited Chas to try a new coffee I got. She refused, but I insisted. When I was making it (pour over this time), I asked why she never came. Still, to that day, she felt bad. I didn't realize it, but I told her not to worry about it. She now jokes about it when we get coffee, and Jack gives her a hard time about it, too. Good news is, she really likes the coffee I make. Bad news, she still gets Starbucks. Haha! 


TL/DR: I make a SO espresso for a friend...she pours it into her Starbucks drink.",1610639910
Coffee,BilledConch8,kx88rr,Newbie tasting help,"Hello! I recently dove into the coffee game with a Baratza virtuoso burr grinder and am using a local roaster but my coffee is tasting very ""off"". I'm not sure how to approach this and looking for some advice.

My usual method is to use a Melita plastic pour over with paper filters, ~1 tbsp of coffee beans for ~8oz of water, using an electric gooseneck kettle with temp control (at ~205 degree F). I use the grinder on setting 20.

The funny thing is that the local roaster seems to have a bitterness to the coffee, almost like milk chocolate, which I am not a fan of. This isn't ideal and I'm seeing a lot of beans are roasted with ""chocolate"", and the generic grocery store coffee beans taste better to me than the local roaster.

I hear local roasters are the way to go but I'm not convinced. Does anyone have a similar experience with ""chocolate"" roasted coffee notes, or am I a victim of a bad palette?

Coffee,Lordmuchnis,kx7zr5,V60 Ultimate Hoffman method for 24g of coffee beans [questions],"So this idea came from the amount of coffee. I think that the final amount is too large. So I tried to change it. I did basic math in terms of how many coffee and water should I use. But Im not sure about time. So tell me if the time should be changed or still. And also, this is just experiment and Im sorry if this similar thing was posted before.

Ratio: 24g of coffee : 400g of water

Time: 0:00
Add 2 times the water for blooming phase
(it should be 48g, but 60 wont get on 3 times the water. Although more acidic parts will get into drink with 60g of water.) Mix it with swirl and let it bloom for 45s.

Time: 0:45
Add 60% of the final drink (keep in mind you already added 48g for bloom), which is 240g. 
So you should add 192g of water in next 30s. Flow rate is 6,4g/s.

Time: 1:15
Add water that aims for 100% of the drink. You should add 160g of water in next 30s. Flow rate 5,3g/s.

Time: 1:45
Stirr it with spoon 2x clockwise, 2x anti-clockwise. Let it draw-down a bit and give it one last gentle swirl to knock of grounds from a wall. And wait for draw-down.

And here comes my question again. How the draw-down should be long? Have I done everything right or has it been complete mistake? Please let me know.
Also if you make it to the end, you are the best. And Im sorry for the way I wrote it so ask me for some missinderstandings.",1610638726

I recently purchased a 2 cup variant of the Bialetti Moka pot. After seasoning the pot as per instructions, my first 3-4 times resulted in a glorious brew. The coffee used to come out of the pot with a very slight hissing/spluttering followed by a glorious brown-honey colored thick brew with ""crema"" or whatever espresso esque characteristic it might provide. Safe to say it was hella satisfying 
However after 15 days of use, I'm still getting decent coffee from it but the coffee just trickles out into the upper container, no bubbles, no glorious fake crema. Just a steady brown trickle. I cleaned the gasket and metal filter quite regularly and I have doubts if they've become lose? Or maybe is it to do with my coffee (preground, i apologise but gotta make do) getting older and hence the lack of aesthetic while brewing.

Coffee,Robdiesel_dot_com,kwwcwc,I love my Philips LatteGo 3200 (the one with the milk container),"Repost: I think I messed up by including a link in the previous post. 


To begin with, I am NOT a coffee guy in any way.  I've tried stuff like the AeroPress my stepdad gave me - cool, but no need.  Regular Gevalia free 14 cup machine? Great, does what I need it to do.  French Press? Meh.  Pour-over?  I like it. 

What I ended up settling on after trying a few machines and methods was to use my Gevalia machine as a pour-over.  I'd boil water in the electric kettle, then either pour it over, or fill the filter and add coffee and let it sit for a minute to steep, and then stick the cup in beneath and let it drain. 

Sticking the cup in pushes on the same level to open the basket as the carafe does, so it worked great for blooming etc. 

Anyway, I'd microwave some milk in a cup, use my little IKEA frother ($3) and fluff the milk, then add the coffee to it.  Done. 

Then a friend had the LatteGo 3200 at his house and I was intrigued.  He made me a cup and it was good AND stupid simple to clean. 

I ended up buying one not long after. I could always return it if it wasn’t as good as it appeared.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s really easy to unpack, the machine was in a bag with handles, to make it easy to get out of the box. Thank you, Philips! Peel off some protective tape, wash the water and milk compartments, soak the water filter and connect everything and plug it in.

The first few cups of coffee were disappointing, but reading a few reviews indicated that the machine adjusts and “breaks in” after which it will produce a consistent and good coffee. This seems to be correct. The coffee pucks came out drier and more solid after about 10 cups. The coffee tasted richer and better than with our usual pour-over method.

The 3200 is the one with the milk container. There are other “lesser” models using a steam wand instead. My understanding from comparing features and parts is that this is a Gaggia Anima Class or Saeco PicoBaristo in a more convenient packaging.

EDIT:  I forgot to add, this thing only adds beans from a non-hinged lid on top, so you don't need a whole lot of space above it to add beans.   Everything else comes out the front or right side.  Also, very little steam comes out of the pre-ground coffee slot, so no worry about warping a too-close cabinet above it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Even regular coffee comes out tasting great** (compared to my usual heathen-made coffee). I can only assume it’s related to the 15 bar / 218 psi scalding hot water it pushes through the beans.

**The milk frother is extremely simple to use**. Fill with desired amount of milk (real milk, almond, oat or whatever variety, it seems to froth them all very well), simply hang it on the protruding steam spigot, and make your coffee.
Besides the pointless lid, it’s two parts, and they rinse/wash easily, and they’re dishwasher safe too.


**Cleanup is simple**. The drip tray slides out along with the cup for the used pucks. Both the tray and cup are dishwasher safe. A quick rinse when you empty it during the week, and run them in the dishwasher every weekend and they are good as new.  The group also rinses easily under the tap. 

&amp;nbsp;

#####A few annoyances:

&amp;nbsp;

**It uses a lot of water**. There’s the rinse when you start it up. Then the steam for the milk froth, the water for the coffee itself, plus the waste water in the tray. Then when it shuts off, it does a quick flush too.
The flushes and wasted water up to about a cup of water that doesn’t make coffee.

**The milk container leaves a little milk in the bottom even when it’s empty**. What I’d like to see here is a tapered ‘floor’ so every drop of milk is funneled down to the siphon hole.


**Another milk container issue is the lid**. I don’t really see a need for it. It’s not hinged or tethered to the container or the bracket the container snaps into. Since you fill with milk, make coffee and then remove it to wash it, the lid really serves no purpose.
I think even if it were hinged and attached, it would probably be in the way more than anything.

**The indicator lines**, both on the milk container and to a degree the water container, are too hard to see. I’ve attached small strips of tape to make easy-to-see fill marks.
It’s not as vital on the water container as you fill it to “full enough, but not so much that you spill” and that’s fine.

Coffee,lvndr___,kwvuim,Expanding horizons with new roasters,"Howdy all! I'm looking to check out some new roasters after making my rounds on most of the noteworthy domestics, and thought I'd start a thread for folks to share their favourite domestic (to you!) roasters.  Figure it may be a good way to share some new and distilled results for folks to more easily find some new roasters they may not have heard of. 


I'm in Canada and my favs are Harken Coffee and Prototype, both producing some of-if not the best brews I've ever had as well as curating an excellent experience in house. 

Harken has a few staples as well as a few rotating special selections, all of which have been exceptionally delicious. 

Prototype is on a whole other level with their selection, I have yet to be disappointed with anything they've touched. Beans seem to have a higher tolerance for the hotter brews for all of you that brew right off boil! 

Both of these roasters in my opinion do a fantastic job sourcing and roasting to a very high standard, definitely amongst Canada's top for me. 

Looking forward to trying some of your recommendations!",1610590064

Coffee,Robdiesel_dot_com,kwulk8,I love my Philips LatteGo 3200 (the one with the milk frother container),"This is basically a cut &amp; paste from what I put up for a friend to read over here;
https://www.robdiesel.com/wordpress/2021/01/review-philips-lattego-3200-espresso-machine/

&amp;nbsp;

To begin with, I am NOT a coffee guy in any way.  I've tried stuff like the AeroPress my stepdad gave me - cool, but no need.  Regular Gevalia free 14 cup machine? Great, does what I need it to do.  French Press? Meh.  Pour-over?  I like it. 

What I ended up settling on after trying a few machines and methods was to use my Gevalia machine as a pour-over.  I'd boil water in the electric kettle, then either pour it over, or fill the filter and add coffee and let it sit for a minute to steep, and then stick the cup in beneath and let it drain. 

Sticking the cup in pushes on the same level to open the basket as the carafe does, so it worked great for blooming etc. 

Anyway, I'd microwave some milk in a cup, use my little IKEA frother ($3) and fluff the milk, then add the coffee to it.  Done. 

Then a friend had the LatteGo 3200 at his house and I was intrigued.  He made me a cup and it was good AND stupid simple to clean. 

I ended up buying one not long after. I could always return it if it wasn’t as good as it appeared.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s really easy to unpack, the machine was in a bag with handles, to make it easy to get out of the box. Thank you, Philips! Peel off some protective tape, wash the water and milk compartments, soak the water filter and connect everything and plug it in.

The first few cups of coffee were disappointing, but reading a few reviews indicated that the machine adjusts and “breaks in” after which it will produce a consistent and good coffee. This seems to be correct. The coffee pucks came out drier and more solid after about 10 cups. The coffee tasted richer and better than with our usual pour-over method.

The 3200 is the one with the milk container. There are other “lesser” models using a steam wand instead. My understanding from comparing features and parts is that this is a Gaggia Anima Class or Saeco PicoBaristo in a more convenient packaging.

EDIT:  I forgot to add, this thing only adds beans from a non-hinged lid on top, so you don't need a whole lot of space above it to add beans.   Everything else comes out the front or right side.  Also, very little steam comes out of the pre-ground coffee slot, so no worry about warping a too-close cabinet above it.

&amp;nbsp;

Even regular coffee comes out tasting great (compared to my usual heathen-made coffee). I can only assume it’s related to the 15 bar / 218 psi scalding hot water it pushes through the beans.

The milk frother is extremely simple to use. Fill with desired amount of milk (real milk, almond, oat or whatever variety, it seems to froth them all very well), simply hang it on the protruding steam spigot, and make your coffee.
Besides the pointless lid, it’s two parts, and they rinse/wash easily, and they’re dishwasher safe too.


Cleanup is simple. The drip tray slides out along with the cup for the used pucks. Both the tray and cup are dishwasher safe. A quick rinse when you empty it during the week, and run them in the dishwasher every weekend and they are good as new.

&amp;nbsp;

#####A few annoyances:

&amp;nbsp;

It uses a lot of water. There’s the rinse when you start it up. Then the steam for the milk froth, the water for the coffee itself, plus the waste water in the tray. Then when it shuts off, it does a quick flush too.
The flushes and wasted water up to about a cup of water that doesn’t make coffee.

The milk container leaves a little milk in the bottom even when it’s empty. What I’d like to see here is a tapered ‘floor’ so every drop of milk is funneled down to the siphon hole.


Another milk container issue is the lid. I don’t really see a need for it. It’s not hinged or tethered to the container or the bracket the container snaps into. Since you fill with milk, make coffee and then remove it to wash it, the lid really serves no purpose.
I think even if it were hinged and attached, it would probably be in the way more than anything.

The indicator lines, both on the milk container and to a degree the water container, are too hard to see. I’ve attached small strips of tape to make easy-to-see fill marks.
It’s not as vital on the water container as you fill it to “full enough, but not so much that you spill” and that’s fine.


The drip tray gets a lot of water in it, even if you, like me, put a little cup to catch the pre- and post-coffee flushes. The indicator for that is a little float that rises up and alerts you, but by the time it floats up the tray is full enough to make it a very careful walk to the sink to avoid spilling.

Travel mugs – it’s not quite tall enough to accommodate them, which I think is strange in this day and age. My favorite mug fits under with a slight tilt, but otherwise I’d have to just make one or two cups of coffee and pour it into the travel mug.

Coffee,aiherrera97,kwu04n,Fellow Stagg issues ?,"Hey! So I just got my Stagg kettle and I read through the instructions but I’m noticing and things going on with mine that I haven’t heard in review videos or blogs. 

1) when I set the temperature to 203 degrees it doesn’t ever stay on 203. It bounces from 205 down to 202. Yes I understand it should do this when like settling on 203 but I’ve turned it on, set it, and have walked away to see if it will land on 203 and stay there after some time. It does not. It just keeps bouncing between temperatures. 

2) besides the bouncing and not setting on the temperature I desire, it’ll go way past. So I have a picture of setting it to 117 and instead of stopping (or bouncing around it) it keeps going to like 127! 

3) this isn’t as important but it’s driving me insane. I have been playing the wormy game and have noticed that I’ll click over to move right or left and the knob clicks but the worm doesn’t move. It’ll be four or five clicks in and the worm doesn’t move. I know this sounds really stupid but I don’t understand how people are getting their ridiculous times when half the time my knob isn’t registering when I click it over.

Coffee,Andrew12Dance,kwovjz,There is a particular roasted property I can’t understand...,"I’m probably not nearly as hard core as many on this sub, so could really use your knowledge/help in figuring this out!!

Last year in NYC, my girlfriend (longtime coffee drinker/aficionado) and I would frequently go to a neighborhood Italian restaurant, where their coffee was unlike anything we’d ever had. It had this nutty roastedness/sweetness that was completely unique. The thing is, it was a pretty standard Lavazza. What’s more, it was highly inconsistent each time we went, until our regular server realized that it was only when the coffee was at the very bottom of the pot that it had this unique property (we would actually call in before coming, so important to us it became and so good was it!)

Anyway, we bought the same exact Lavazza for our home and nothing, no reproduction of that flavor. Other attempts to get that taste (Illy at Italian places, various espressos, general coffee drinking since, etc.) have yielded nothing. We got a Nespresso and while we’ve been enjoying it, absolutely no blend/variety has this.

So we chalked it up to a fluke, some quirk of chemistry that would be achieved again... who knows when?

But then this happened, and it blew our mind: on a short vacation we needed some quick, easy coffee and picked this up at a local grocery store:

https://www.target.com/p/starbucks-subtly-sweet-medium-roast-coffee-48-fl-oz/-/A-78295046

Mind you, neither of us like Starbucks all that much but again, it was a quick purchase and we figured it would be fine.

OH MY GOD. It was perfect, and it recreated the same experience as that Italian restaurant. *Something* about this particular product gives it that exact same roast flavor. We are enamored with it now. The thing is though, again, we don’t even like Starbucks traditionally and I can certainly attest that nothing we’ve ever drunk there even comes close to this.

So what do you all think? (Maybe even one of you would be willing to go try this (?)) We would love to determine what this property is so that we can obtain it more regularly, possibly even intensify it/find even better examples out there. It’s basically like we just discovered some spice and now want to know which cuisines use it in spades! :)

Thanks so much!!",1610569027

Over the months I've picked up a lot of new gear, beans, and skills that really helped me improve the quality of my brew. I'm a teacher, so at this point my bloodstream is probably 80% coffee. I actually got sick with COVID a few weeks ago and completely lost my sense of smell. It was absolutely miserable and coffee became completely flat and bitter. I couldn't get any complex notes of flavor, aroma, or anything. It was horrible. My sense of smell has gradually come back and I think I'm finally back this morning. I made my cup like I always do. #17 on my Barraza grinder, using my V60. I just bought myself a new kettle that allows me to get the perfect temperature on my water. I tried to be really deliberate with the pour and count out the time as well. When I finished brewing and took a sip, I was completely blown away by the flavor and aroma of the coffee I had just made. I always thought those tasting notes were a bit of bullshit, but this time  I really tasted the dark chocolate and cherry notes. It's something I've been thinking about since this morning. I don't know when I'll be able to create another cup that good, but I hope to try again later and see if I can come close.

Coffee,Barisaxgod,kwlo5u,Some little bits of coffee advice that I haven't seen discussed much.,"Over time, I've picked up some little tidbits of knowledge through experimentation, and some of them don't seem to be discussed much. Here are a few little tips that some people light find useful.

* A lens blower is a fantastic tool for cleaning your grinder. It's the best way to clean out a grounds chute or burr chamber, but a toothbrush is still better for the burrs themselves.
* The first sip of a well-mixed espresso will have the worst taste but the best texture. This is due to crema. Crema tastes more bitter and less sweet than the rest of the espresso (crema-lovers need not reply), but it also has great texture (because foam), and if the strength of your espresso is homogenous because you stirred it, that will give the perception of more texture and more bitterness in the first sip of an espresso. For this reason, I would recommend skimming the crema off of your espressos when you are dialing in, when you typically only take one sip of an espresso.
* Never buy natural processed coffees from wet or cool regions (i.e. Guatemala, Sumatra). A lot of sun and heat is needed for a successful natural process (which is why it's relatively popular in parts of Africa), and naturals from cool or wet regions tend to stray on the side of barnyard as opposed to fruity and jammy. I can't fathom why roasters still sometimes sell naturals from cool/wet regions. I'm sure there are some good ones, but I haven't come across one yet. Locations of these wet/cool regions can be weird too, because while Guatemala is usually cool and wet, neighboring El Salvador is far hotter and drier on average, and produces some very good naturals.
* In filter coffee, I often find it easier to diagnose underextraction by looking for a lack of sweetness and texture than by looking for tons of sourness. I'll occasionally recalibrate my reference for underextraction by brewing a v60 with way too coarse of a grind size, and more often than not, the lack of sweetness and texture is more obvious than an increase of acidity. There is an increase in perceived acidity in underextracted coffee compared to well-extracted coffee, but it's not so obvious as to be the first thing I look for.

I hope at least a few people find this helpful, thanks for reading to the end, and have an excellent day.",1610560019

Coffee,Vicosku,kwki42,Roast Level Perspective from 1975 Book,"I found an old book titled, ""[The Book of Coffee &amp; Tea](https://imgur.com/JPIbhU5)"" written in 1975. Within, the American preference for lighter-roasted coffees is described. I find it interesting to read the perspective of a time before Starbucks swept the nation, nearly 50 years ago. I thought you might as well. Specifically, this line makes me grin:

""A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.""

Here are links to photos of the pages, and the transcribed text:

[The Variety of Roasts](https://imgur.com/hsEfhPB)

The roasting of coffee turns the beans brown; the longer they're roasted, the darker they get. Coffee roasted too light won't have much of a coffee taste at all. Coffee can also be roasted so dark that it tastes burnt. Between these two extremes are a variety of roasts all tasting like coffee, each appealing to particular tastes.

Simply put, the darker coffee is roasted, the darker it tastes. Is any one roast the optimum? No, just as it would be silly to say that steak should only be broiled ""medium."" Is dark-roasted coffee stronger? No. It is common to credit dark-roasted coffee with producing a very, very strong beverage, but this is not accurate. It would be best to say that dark-roasted coffee has a characteristic ""dark-roasted"" taste, even if that may seem to be begging the question. The strength of coffee is directly dependent on the amount of soluble solids in the brew, that is, the solution of coffee in water. If coffee is ""strong"" it should be because more coffee is used, resulting in a stronger solution, not because of the roast itself. Espresso is in fact usually brewed with twice the amount of coffee normally recommended.

Not only does coffee get darker in color the longer it is roasted, but it also loses more weight and swells more in size. Oils held within the beans of a lighter roast are driven to the surface in a dark roast. Dark-roasted beans appear shiny. They have very slightly less caffeine and are somewhat less acidic than light-roasted beans. They are slightly more susceptible to becoming stale because surface waxes that remain intact on light-roasted beans are destroyed by more prolonged heating. The characteristic dark roasted flavor tends to overshadow the more subtle flavors produced by lighter roasting. Some of the more delicate flavor oils and aromatics are in fact destroyed by dark roasting. What dark-roasted coffee may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up for in force. A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.

[Detailed Roast Levels](https://imgur.com/CMFrZsX)

Light city roast: In sections of the West, this is the standard. The bean is not fully developed, the color more cinnamon-like than brown, the flavor thin.

City roast: The most widely used style in this country. Also called brown roast or American roast, it is the preference of most consumers here. This roast yields a beverage that may lack brilliance and come up on the flat side.

Full city roast: Favored by some regional roasters in cosmopolitan centers, particularly New York City. Slightly longer roasted, the bean is dark brown, shows no oil on the surface, and gives a deeper heartier cup. The American roasts of specialty shops are likely to be full city rather than city.

Brazilian: Don't confuse this with the name given to coffee grown in Brazil. Just darker than full city, this roast has the faintest hint of dark roast flavor. A trace of oil shows on the bean.

Viennese roast: There seems to be the least consensus on what this roast is, probably because there are many variations, even in Vienna. It falls midway between full city and French roasts. Mix half and half of these two roasts.

French roast (New Orleans roast): With this roast oiliness is quite apparent on the bean's surface and the color is burnt umber, the color of semi sweet chocolate. The flavor is remarkably different from any of the lighter roasts. It approaches Espresso flavor but remains smooth. It is French roasted coffee to which chicory is added for Louisiana style coffee. Two commercially prepared examples of this coffee/chicory mixture are Luzianne and French Market.

Spanish/Cuban/French-Italian roast: Darker than French but not quite Italian, this coffee is great for those who want Espresso without the bite. Mix French and Italian roasts, if this happy medium is not available, and you'll get very close to the flavor. Commercially prepared versions of this roast are Bustelo and El Pico. Some A&amp;P stores have coffee in this roast in the bean.

Italian/ Espresso roast: This roast is the highest, heaviest, darkest. Almost to carbonization. The bean surface is shiny and oily, the color black, the flavor Italian. Medaglia D'Oro is a commercially prepared example of this roast.

Coffee,sentientrip,kwkcqj,"Been manual brewing since last October, some tips","It took me a while to dial in my tastes (I brew exclusively with V60 and Aeropress, 1-2 cups) and there are a few things which really helped me along the way. At first, the coffee was just not coming out very good at all (bitter, intense, severe) and it took me a lot of trial and error to get to a consistent point.

\- Invest in a temperature controlled kettle. This helps you keep another variable constant as you dial in your taste. Obviously you should already have a nice burr grinder which is the first biggest investment. I pretty much stick with 96C for all my light roasts.

\- Google image search coffee grind size. This one had the largest impact on taste for me. I thought I was grinding medium-fine but it was closer to fine, and in the end I actually moved to more of a medium grind for both my V60 and Aeropress. It also depends on the coffee bean, strangely enough. For one light roast I was sitting at 22 on the Baratza Encore, but for a different light roast that was coming out harsh and i moved towards 24 (this confused me because I saw a lot of other people using around 15-16 grind setting, but when i compared my grind size to images online i found it was much too fine on my machine. So not all sizes are universal, i guess. It took me a LONG time to figure this out, because going from 15-16 to 18 wasn't giving me much of a difference). 

\- If you are buying your beans at a local coffee shop, ask them to do a pour over for you of the coffee you are buying. This helped me a lot because i was able to compare and constrast with how i was brewing. I actually prefer my brew method now compared to how they brewed because i like to brew a smoother cup, but i have a jumping off point for how it should taste.

\- Stick to the same recipe so you again are keeping variables as constant as possible, and just messing with one at a time.

\- Brew small batches (15g, etc) and more times in a day so you can play around with the recipe, and then move towards a larger brew once you dial it in. Some days i would do 3-4 brews lol, its fun!

&amp;#x200B;

Now i get the subtle hints in the taste once i dialed it in, for example i am doing this El Salvador brew right now which has hints of honey in it, very nice! I shared some of my coffee with neighbor and family and they said i ruined their coffee for them, they tasted no bitterness, said it was the smoothest cup they have had and now having trouble going back to their bitter coffee!

What I've realized is especially with the Sagada Dark roast 18g does not even some close to fitting in the portafilter, the Columbian it's way below. How worried should I be about dose vs the spacing? I'm using the standard tamper which I know isn't consistent but it just doesn't seem right. 


The biggest problem: I set it to program and time out how long it takes to get to 36g. On a grind setting of 6 no matter what it always seems to be around 8-12secs. Even on the finest of settings no matter the coffee, no matter how much I tamper it, no matter how much I change I am NO WHERE clue to 25-30secs.

I have a [Hario Skerton hand grinder](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/skerton-hand-coffee-grinder) that I could use for some tests at the weekend if people could reccommend the number of notches to set it to for V60. Maybe the grind I'm being sent is too fine? I just don't have time to hand-grind beans every morning before work.

I'm also aware that the filter papers made outside of Japan are slower so I could try and get my hands on a faster paper next time I run out.

Would I get better results with the 01 size V60 when I am just brewing 250ml for myself or should this not really make a difference?",1610552505

Coffee,4hilodendr0n,kwiurt,Is there an easier product for making aeropress style ‘espresso’?,"I got the aeropress for making ‘espresso’ (concentrated coffee, or whatever you guys on this sub call it). I have an iced latte addiction and I can’t really tell the difference between the real stuff vs. what the aeropress makes. Anyway, I was wondering if there was product that wasn’t as labor intensive as the aeropress that would make similar quality fauxspresso. It takes 3 or 4 brewings in the aeropress to get a decent amount of coffee and I end up spending 20 minutes on it in the morning. Is there a product that isn’t as labor intensive that would give me similar quality for iced latte drinks? Thanks.",1610552274
Coffee,motoridersd,kwispg,Mocccamaster and Breville Smart Grinder Pro - Looking for pointers,"Hello! I've spent some time on this sub trying to improve my at home brewing over the past year. One of the best changes I made thanks to reading was using proper mineralized water over our very heavy tap water (San Diego). 

Our morning pots have improved a lot since then. Also moved to better local beans (Dark Horse Coffee). We like medium to light roasts, we drink it black and enjoy finding the notes of the beans. 

Equipment:

* Moccamaster with Manual Basket
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro. Usually use the lowest end of the Drip setting, but lately have been trying going coarser
* Third Water water
* 0.01 gram precision scale
* Melitta #4 white filters
* Ratio is 1000 ml water (not usually weighed though, using brewer tank markings) and 62g coffee

Lately I've been feeling like our coffee hasn't been the best it can be. I've played around with grind sizes and Moccamaster techniques, and I feel like lately nothing I do seems to get me to the sweet spot. Especially when comparing my version of the brew to a drip coffee of the same beans from the local shop.

The Moccamaster technique I use is rinsing the paper filter with 200 ml water, adding grounds and locking basket, stirring grounds and opening basket full way. Stirring halfway through (at about 500 ml), then tapping basket once water tank is empty. I've tried letting the grounds bloom by turning off the coffee maker, but I haven't been very consistent with this.

I've been using a spreadsheet to track grind size setting, water and coffee amount, and notes about the brewing technique as well as rating each brew. 

So, I think at this point my issue is the Breville grinder. When I first got it, I read a lot of people saying it wasn't the best for drip, as it was better suited for espresso. Back then I liked the idea of having a hopper to hold the beans and a programmable timer to determine how much coffee to use. I no longer use either of those features so it has become a decoration that is used in a very manual way.

I've tried using the Coffee Compass to dial in the brews, but I must admit I am not very good at determining exactly where I am, if it's under or over extracted. I just know it's not as good. Sometimes it's too bitter, sometimes it's a bit ""vegetal"" (I think).

One thing I've noticed with the beans I get, is that there are a lot of lighter colored grinds, that look like shavings, at the top of the ground beans. Are these the fines that I read about? Are these bad/unwanted and an indicator of an issue with the grinder or its configuration? Will these produce unwanted flavor profiles?

One metric I am not very clear on is, how much time should 1000 ml of water take to brew on the Moccamaster. I see between 4 to 6 minutes. I start counting as soon as the water hits the grounds, but do I turn off the basket when the flow becomes a drip? How long do I wait before shutting off the basket and stopping the counter.

This morning I went coarser than usual, and counted about 5 minutes from water hitting the grounds to all the water in the basket being below the grounds and the flow becoming a drip. Used La Colombe Mexico Sierra Sur (sometimes we buy these if we're in UTC) and even though I got one of the notes when smelling it (rose), the coffee tastes a bit salty/sour/vegetal (I think). So that would tell me I went too coarse on the grounds. Yesterday, with a finer grind than today, it was a bit bitter

Anyway, any tips would be highly appreciated as I must be missing something.",1610552110
Coffee,raindog,kwilvc,Grind time too long - espresso with an Encore,"I have a new Breville Bambino and I'm using my Encore grinder set at 10-12. And I'm okay with the results. I know both machines are entry-ish, but they're suiting me just fine for now. My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to grind 18g of beans in the Encore. Sometimes 2 minutes - or longer. There is always a lot of popcorning of beans at the end. Is this a normal time? When I'm grinding for a pour over, at around 18, it takes a much shorter amount of time. And I understand that's due to grind size. But... 2 minutes seems extreme. Or is it? 

I assume higher-end grinders will do this job faster. But what's a step up from here - one for both pour overs and espresso grinds, that will accomplish its tasks more quickly?",1610551563

Coffee,octan2,kwi6vp,Alternative grider to Wilfa Uniform?,"Hi All,

I am currently in a situation where I am looking to upgrade my coffee grinder for drip coffee only. My initial plan was to get a Wilfa Uniform, as it is right in my budget. But, it turns out getting one to the US is currently a but more difficult and expensive than I thought it would be.

I know that the Fellow Ode is right in the same price range, but I have heard very mixed reviews that make me think that it may not be worth the money. I also check r/coffeeswap pretty consistently, but haven't seen any electric brew grinders posted recently.

I currently have a Kinu Simplicity with the espresso burrs, and an Encore with the upgraded M2 Burrs. Do you think that I should just keep what I have and wait until I have a bit larger of a budget to really upgrade?

I look forward to any advice that y'all may have!",1610550337

Based on recommendations from here I tried everything from Bird Rock Volcan Azul to Wild Gift El Aguila and every profile in between, and simply don't like them.

Get ready to cringe: I've had a few specialty brands, but honestly find myself enjoying things like Starbucks' Christmas Blend, Peet's Major Dickenson's, and things like that the most. Strong and bold, no fruit flavors whatsoever.

Coffee,Steexe,kwfx2o,V60 problems adjusting for the perfect cup,"So, I’ve had my V60 for around two weeks now. I’ve been using it pretty much daily following James Hoffmann’s v60 technique. 

The first week or so I managed to brew wonderful coffee. The coffee bed was flat after each brew and the coffee tasted evenly extracted, clear and sweet. Then I wanted to experiment a bit and started messing with water temperatures and grind sizes. The coffee got gradually worse and I struggled to get a flat grounds bed even when I tried. I always ended up with a dome in the middle of the grounds. Yesterday I hit the rock bottom and brewed so over-extracted and astrigent coffee that I couldn’t drink it. Today I tried to go back to the same water temperature and grind setting I had last time I brewed a great cup - to no avail. The coffee was better than yesterday, yet still bitter or sour.

What troubles me the most, is that I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong or differently from what I did at the beginning, when the coffee was still good. I’m using Wilfa Uniform grinder and the last great cup of coffee was with grind setting 24. Water temperatures I’ve used have all been within 94-97 celsius range for medium roasted coffee. The drawdowns have been 2:50-3:30 minutes. I’m using 30g of coffee to 500g of water. The coffee itself is good and of great quality.

Coffee,the_commissaire,kwf0xk,[Gear] Grinder recommendations - for multiple grind settings,"Hi everyone.

I am a fan of using lots of different ways of making coffee. Some days cafetiere, some days espresso, some days mokka, pour over... 

Right now I have a hand grinder for espresso &amp; pour over and then just get the place I get my coffee from to grind it for me in a reasonable ""general purpose"" setting for the other methods.

**Does anyone know of a product on the market (new or used) that sort of lets me change the grind setting and quantity on the fly?**

I am not too fussed about whether it has a large hopper or if you have the weight the beans and fill it up for each grind. I am also kind of willing to sacrifice a bit of grind quality for the functionality (after all its just has to be better than using pre-ground). 

I am fairly flexible on budget. But ideally less than £200 (~270usd, ~230eur)... but I am interested to hear whats on the market at a higher price point if its gong to be worth it; if it can be had for even cheaper then I am all ears.

Coffee,muskogeee,lbpyvq,"Trying to up my coffee game, what am I doing wrong? Is it just cheap, bad, beans?","TL;DR: Can good coffee be made without spending $30+ on a 12oz bag of beans?

Lately I have decided to start taking my coffee more seriously.  Up until now I just bought whatever ground coffee was on sale, not the cheapest bottom of the barrel stuff like Maxwell House but things like Gevalia.

My first new purchase was a Baratza Encore, since it's my understanding that the grinder is the most important piece of equipment.

As for brewing, right now I just have a cheapo Mr. Coffee drip maker, a French press, and I cold brew occasionally.

My water comes from a well, is chlorinated in a contact tank, then filtered through a whole house filtration and softening system, then I have a 5 stage reverse osmosis under sink system for drinking water, so I doubt that's a problem.

All the coffee I've made in my new endeavor has just been mehh.  Bitter, acidic, and just doesn't taste like coffee or have the aroma of coffee.  I don't know if it's my technique, my grind settings, or what I suspect most, cheap, bad beans.

I've been watching a lot of coffee YouTubers, like James Hoffmann, but none of them ever seem to really talk about the beans they use, or whether or not you have to spend a fortune on beans to have good coffee.

So far I've tried Cafe Don Pablo, SF Bay, and Starbucks beans,  am I just wasting my time trying to go for ""budget"" beans?  even though many websites list them as the best affordable coffee and they are extremely highly rated on Amazon?  I like the coffee when I go to Starbucks, do they not actually use the beans they sell?  Do I really have to spend $30-$40 for a 12oz bag to get good coffee?

My main method is grinding 32g of beans at grind setting 26 on the Encore.  Preheating my French Press, blooming with 64g of 195 degree water for 45 seconds, adding the rest up to a total of 500g and steeping until I reach a total of 4 minutes, then gently plunging and pouring.

I really feel like just throwing some Maxwell House in the Mr. Coffee has given me better results, and filled the house with that unmistakable coffee fragrance, which all the beans I've tried just seem to lack.

Like I said, I'm sure it's the beans and my own fault for going ""budget"", but I really don't want to have to spend $50/lb on beans, so now I'm worried I've just wasted my money on a grinder.

Could someone recommend beans that are maybe in the middle?  I don't mind a little bitter or acidic but I just want coffee that tastes and smells like coffee.

Also, what kind of brewing method should I try next, V60, Chemex, Clever Dripper, etc.

BTW, I am in the US, Central Florida.

Thanks for the input!",1612366022

I'm 18 years old living in Sydney and is looking forward to have a part time job as a barista or working in a cafe industry since i'm currently in university. I currently work at Mcdonald's in the front counter and Mccafe. I've only been working for 3 months and got crew of the month plus compliments from customers about their coffee. 

I learnt McCafe myself and a lot of youtube tutorials and fell in love with the art of making coffee since then. However, my coffee is still not perfect especially latte arts which I mess up most of the time but I am eager to learn more about it. 

Although I enjoy working at Maccas, its a dream of mine to become a barista since I really am passionate about it. I have applied at Starbucks but sadly did not get an interview so I am thinking of getting a barista certificate.

I'm slowly stepping into the world of coffee-making and today, trusting my italian roots, I bought my first moka pot. Now, I know that grinding your own beans is preferable to using pre-ground ones (from a perspective of taste if not of convenience). I gather the ""best"" grinder would be a really good electric burr grinder. Unfortunately, I don't have the money for that, so I'm stuck with deciding between a electric blade grinder and some decent hand grinder (I don't know which one yet, but I guess finding a decent and not too expensive hand grinder is feasible), which would be a burr grinder.
Not having any real experience with either option makes it difficult to make this decision. 
From your experience, do you have any advice for me? Do you think it's better using the electric blade grinder (I already have at home) or a decent hand grinder (if so, any specific recommendations?)?

Thank you very much  :)",1612303123

Have been using a French press for a few years - my go-to is actually Nespresso, but in the pandemic I started getting beans locally and brewing manually. Eventually got bored of it and decided to ""upgrade"". 

I decided on the Chemex. The idea of a clean and bright cup really appealed to me, and it seemed like the clean-up would be much easier. Debated between the Chemex and Aeropress since I am usually just brewing for myself or two of us at most, but settled on the Chemex. Not exactly sure why...

I made up my mind before trying to purchase. I'm in Canada, and it was actually really hard to find the Chemex in stock anywhere! Finally got my hands on one, but then the mission became getting filters. I found a place with them in stock in the US, had them shipped to the border and then picked up by a parcel forwarding company - to try and save cost I ended up ordering 4 boxes, so now I am definitely committed!

Had the chance to try it all out today and... it was awesome! The brew was really clean which was a very nice change from my usual French press. I think I lucked out with technique as it was my first time doing a pour-over. Looking forward to trying it out more, and upgrading my grinder next (currently using a hand grinder)!.

My first instinct is to change the coarseness of the grind to something finer as the coffee tastes somewhat empty. However, I choose not to.

Instead, on the third day, I simply run it through again, same procedure as I've done the 2 previous days. This time however, it tastes great. Sweet, with acidity but not overbearing, nice clarity and the taste lingers in the mouth instead of dissipating immediately.

I run on a Hario V60 Switch immersion dripper (I'm quite new to it) and I suspect that me allowing the water used to bloom to flow through led to part of the coffee being very under-extracted.

During the blooms phase which i used 50 grams of water for 15 grams of coffee i tried stirring, swirling and doing nothing at all. Rest of the brew was to aim 150 grams in the V60 until 1 min with circular pours and after that aiming for 250 grams until 1.30 with a center pour. After pouring a little swirl to the bed and let it drain.
Using the same grind setting taste profiles were very different.
The one with stirred bloom tasted more bitter compared the other ones.
The swirled bloom had some sort of an astringent taste and mole dulled out flavor notes but less bitterness than that of stirred and a little hint of sweetness.
The bloom with no agitation other than pouring had this juicy clear taste good aftertaste with long lasting sweetness but with a little less body.

TLDR : Different blooming techniques arises curiosity and results with some experiments.

Coffee,PeaTearGriphon,lawves,Dumb question but how do you turn off the warming plate on a Breville Precision Brewer,"Everything I've found talks about turning it off permanently in the settings but I just want to turn it off when I grab my last cup of coffee.  I know it's a simple thing but I rinse out my carafe right after I empty it but I can't put it back until the 2 hours is up.

I've looked through the manual and the only thing I could find is the hold the start/cancel button for 3 seconds but that doesn't work. On my cheap $20 predecessor it was as simple as turning off the switch.  I feel like I'm missing something really easy here and will probably feel dumb once I know the answer but enough is enough.  I need to find this out.",1612276602
Coffee,financiallyanal,law6wd,Equipment Input Requested,"Background: Have been enjoying coffee for years and even farmed it for a few months on a coffee farm. I have picked up methods since including doing a pour over (into a mug or with Chemed) and French press. I use a Javapresse hand grinder and pretty good coffee bean from a local roaster.

My questions are:

1. Does weighing the coffee have a benefit over just scooping the same amount? If so, I need a weighing scale.

2. I'm considering the Baratza Encore to get a more consistent grind and better coffee as a result. My thought process also includes automating the existing task. Am I right to expect a better or more consistent grind?

3. What do folks here recommend for their daily morning coffee? Do you use a drip style brewer, or stick to methods such as the French press or pour over? Are there brewers you recommend? What would even make one better than others in terms of the quality of coffee I get?

Thanks in advance for your help.",1612274794

I‚Äôm looking for a decent grinder so I can use fresh beans with my Chemex rather than pre-ground stuff. I‚Äôve tried a spice grinder that was marketed as a ‚Äòcoffee grinder‚Äô but found that it was too much of an inconsistent grind.

Coffee,KlonHarcos,lauok3,Breville/sage barista express replacement,"Dear people of coffee reddit,

So this quarantine made me pick up v60 as a new obsession, and now i'm planning on buying a proper grinder instead of the handgrinder I have which is already a hard decision. At the same time I have my beloved barista express which I adore, but the problem is that its girnder is not comparable to a nische zero or anything at the same price range so most likely it will be sitting there unused. (i mean the grinder part)

So my question is, which espresso machine(around the same price range) would be a good replacement for the barista express. I was looking into stuff like the infuser but I live in europe so it is quite a stretch to get it here. My other candidate is the guaggia classic, but as I know it is quite a DIY machine which is not what i'm looking for atm.

I'd appreciate any recommendations. The problem is that i don't have the funds to both buy the grinder and a new espresso machine so i'd need to sell it second hand first.

Cheers",1612269910

Coffee,AJL912-aber,lashee,Bialetti Venus 4 cups filter plate is too loose (?),"An issue I've been having forever now: 

I read that there shouldn't be any wiggle room between the gasket and the filter plate. When I bought the Moka Pot (used), I thought the gasket was worn out, so I bought a new one (original Bialetti brand, in a local shop), but it stayed the same, when the gasket touches the filter edge on one side, it has almost 2 mm of room on the other, if I push the gasket to touch the filter on the ""sides"", (so that it snuggles up on three sides), the room on the fourth side is about 4 mm. I figured the filter plate could be the wrong size, but its outer diameter is exactly 60 mm, as specified by Bialetti. The gasket is the correct 65/51 mm diameter, too. I've read that the gasket has to wear in, but it has been like this for about two years of daily to bi-weekly use. The Moka Pot works, but I'm afraid that it could be working better if this was fixed. What do I do?",1612260782

Instead they only offer Je and Js and part of their ""J"" series. Does anyone know if they are just sold out or is there any other reason?

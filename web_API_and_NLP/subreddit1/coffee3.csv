Coffee,WellNah,lsazk5,Longer V60 drawdown times??,"Having messed about with my JX, I feel like im chasing grinds that have a longer drawdown. Usually around 3:30-4:00 depending on the coffee. From pictures and threads, seems like people are grinding quite a bit coarser than me to chase 2:30-3:00 times? The coffee bed actually shows individual grounds whereas mine is more like bumpy mud. Yet when i brew with drawdowns of less than 3:20 the coffee seems overwhelmingly sour, clouding individual origin flavours. Do I stand alone in brewing slightly longer?

Coffee,rabidsoggymoose,ls94if,"Just a warning for people thinking to buy the Cafflano Kompresso - all damage will be user error, and it can't do 9 bar without breaking.","As many other people have found out, the Kompresso's thin metal sheet filter in the filter basket bends and crimps out of shape permanently with anything even remotely resembling 9 bars of pressure. 

FYI this is what Cafflano says when I contacted them on Instagram about the bent filter screen on their basket:

---

Q. Damage on Filter Basket
A. If too much pressure is applied over again (more than 15-16 bars which makes espresso shot over extracted), the Filter Basket can be damaged. There are a few factors to build up too much high pressure that you need not only to avoid over extraction but also to prevent product damage as listed below. 

[Factors to make too high pressure (recommendation on spec)]
(1) Too much coffee grounds (10 to 15 gram)
(2) Too fine espresso grounds (no Turkish grounds: too fine)
(3) Too hard tamping (soft tamping up to 15g grounds, hard tamping down to 10g)

These factors can affect each other so that you need to find optimised result.

---

They seem to believe that 15-16 bars is when their filter screen starts to fail, which is complete nonsense. When I broke mine, for instance, I wasn't anywhere near 15-16 bars and the espresso wasn't overextracted at all. If anything, it tasted *good* and the look of it was pretty excellent.

The physics speak for themselves. To get 15-16 bars of pressure you would need to be putting 91.8kg of pressure on the 6.12cm^2 piston, which is impossible for most people. My entire weight is only 65kg.

So this tells me a few things: 

- Cafflano probably won't be making their basket better if they believe their current basket only breaks at 15 bars.

- Cafflano officially sees any basket damage as user error and won't warranty it.

- The Kompresso will never be able to make ""real"" espresso at 9 bars. Yes, good espresso can often be made at much lower pressures, especially for lighter roasts which turn out super sour at high pressures, but you will never be able to duplicate the results of a real espresso machine like the Flair that can safely do 9 bars all day long. The Kompresso will never be a true Flair competitor because the basket will just break apart if attempted.

- If you want 9 bar espresso, you need to hack together your own basket (the basket width is 47mm and 20mm deep) and the 45mm Zacconi basket fits it:
 https://www.kaffee-netz.de/threads/cafflano-kompresso-tuning.128707/

So in the end, the Kompresso will indeed just be able to make espresso-like drinks. It's kind of sad, really. The Kompresso concept is sound and the 9-bar espresso ""standard"" is completely attainable using this design, but for whatever reason it looks like Cafflano thinks it has already gotten there with the perfect product and likely won't make a better basket. The Kompresso has already been out for several years.

This is their response for getting replacements:

---

For the replacement parts, yes you can buy any parts directly from us. Just make sure which parts you want to buy.

For example, the cost of the filter basket is US$10.00/each, the cost of the shower screen filter(metal part) is US$4.50/each,

The shower screen gasket(red silicon o-ring) is US$4.00 and the shipment is US$15.00 / one shipment to Thailand.

(Laos is not available for the delivery as of now due to COVID-19 and Thailand is cheaper and quicker than China.)

This shipment is made from Korea &amp; by EMS-Economy(K-Packet) and takes about 4 ~ 8 weeks due to COVID-19.

(normaly delivery time was 2 ~ 4 weeks and the delivery cost was US$9.00 via EMS-Economy(K-Packt) before COVID.

yes, we fully agree with that it is not a good time to buy the replacement parts.)",1614267041

My press is 350 ml and I saw online that 13-14 grams of coffee is good, but that amount is a little less than half of the press. Is this normal? It seems like A LOT of coffee to me, I went back online to double check and there are people recommending 1:12 and even 1:16 which would make no sense in my case as it would most likely fill my entire press with just ground coffee.

So it's either that my math is wrong or that I've done some really stupid shit like measuring the coffee beans instead of ground coffee (...because that doesn't matter right?).

Coffee,Dheorl,lrwjfr,Questions Regarding Building an Espresso Machine,"I hope this is an ok place to ask this. The sidebar says all things coffee, and I couldn't think of a better sub, so fingers crossed.

So basically, for reasons I'm not entirely sure about myself, I've decided I fancy a go at building an espresso machine. I'm going to go for a basic spring lever machine; something like a Elektra Micro Casa, and just want to get a few things sorted.

So fundamentals: I need a place for hot water, a way of moving said hot water to under the piston, a spring to supply pressure to the piston and lever to initially compress said spring, a screen to stop the water stirring up the coffee puck and a way of holding said puck?

I'm fine with most of that, but there's a few specific questions I have. First off, when it comes to the piston, they have two gaskets, and at rest the water inlet is between these two gaskets. I'm assuming this isn't a problem, because all machines seem to do it, but it doesn't seem unreasoanble that water could sit between those two gaskets for extended periods and then mix with brewing water. So is it fine if that happens?

Secondly, does it matter where in the group the water inlet is? I assume it can be right at the bottom, but many machine seem to place it higher up. Is there a reason for this, or just that there's no reason not to and it's a design choice?

Lastly, portafilter connection. Obviously most machines go for a simple twist on, but is there any good reason to not go for a simple screw thread?

Thanks for any advice you can give, and yes, I accept I'm possibly a bit crazy for wanting to do this.",1614222492

I'm becoming quite overwhelmed.,"I've read through the post/link that offers great recommendations for espresso makers, based, for what I can tell is mostly on price, which is fine, but I'm afraid I have gotten completely undone by my days of research.

So my situation is this. I've been searching for that perfect espresso machine. I thought it was mostly about price, but I've come to realize it's so much more that that. I'm looking for a relatively easy to use, but still brews a mean cup. I want something that saves me from the daily coffee house trips. I'm looking for a quality espresso, with a good crema. I like my mixed drinks as well, but I honestly don't see myself becoming any sort of an aficionado, so I don't think I want something that needs special attention and dialing in. I've compared the Breville Barista, the Rancillo Silvia Espresso, the Gaggia Classic Pro (and many others) and I just ended up feeling slightly intimidated. I'm wondering if I'd be better with a De'Longhi Stitlosa or even a Brim 19 Bar? Or even one of the hand pulled ones recommend on the link this group has? They seem pretty cool. 

I have a tendency to overthink this kind of stuff and just put myself off from it, and I don't want to do this now. I really enjoy coffee, I'd like to enjoy it even more, but I also want to be realistic and know I'm still pretty much a newb.

Coffee,travanator,lrlswc,Sharing my Breville Precision Brewer method that I'm finally happy with,"After doing pour overs every morning for 8 years, I decided that waking up to good coffee can be a magical experience that makes a typical workday morning better. So I pulled the trigger on the Breville Precision Brewer (glass carafe).

I program the brewer the night before probably 4 days a week. Yes, some flavor is lost by grinding the beans 8 hours ahead of brewing, but it's pretty minimal in my opinion.

**Here we go:**

* 60 grams of coffee to 886 grams of water (66.7 grams per liter)
* Baratza Encore click 18 (medium grind)
* Bloom: 40 seconds
* Temperature: 201F
* Flow rate: Medium
* *Here's the secret sauce*... **two** pre-wet #4 Melitta paper filters for the cone attachment
   * If I'm programming for overnight brewing, I actually do wet the filters with cold water and don't believe this to negatively impact the flavor, almost no extraction should occur
   * If I use just one filter, the flow rate is too fast for my grind, and going finer with the grind size for me always made it worse
   * Two filters slows down the drain rate but not too much

**Some other tips:**

* The shower head has a fairly strong pour right down the middle and it makes an indent that impacts even extraction, so instead of a typical divot in the middle that you'd do for a pour over, I actually try to make a mound in the middle to compensate for this
* I usually have the hot plate off because it gets VERY hot and can burn the coffee - I just pour any that I want to keep warm in a thermos. However, sometimes I'll have the hot plate on for just a few minutes then switch it off

Coffee,TalSOrbach,lrdcpk,1zpresso JE Plus VS JX Pro,"I know that generally that JX is supposed to be better value for money, and JE is supposed to be more espresso forward, compared to JX.

Putting price aside (I might be able to buy a used JE Plus for the same price as a new JX Pro), which one makes more sense for me if I make more filter (v60, AeroPress) than espresso?",1614174684

Coffee,GroundbreakingWar219,lrcpl9,Timing for grinder when grinding for V60,"Hi all, given that everyone uses different types of grinders, do you have any suggestions on what appropriate timing ratios are the most appropriate for V60 pour over.

For example for 30grams I timed around 30 seconds at an adjustment of 20 for Baratza encore electric grinder. This is a relatively medium-coarse grind and it tastes good however, I just want to always improve on it.

Thanks in advance!",1614172784

Coffee,Right_Explanation270,lr9fj2,When is extraction over?,"Hi,
I've been using a v60 for about a month now and I was wondering when do you remove It from the cup? Because people talk about different brew times but I don't know if It corresponds to the point where water stops dripping from the bottom or someplace before. 
What do you usually time?",1614161809
Coffee,Casiofi,lr7pug,"Does anyone have any experience contacting Knock, the company that makes the Aergrind?","Hi all,

Apologies if this doesn't fit into the sub. I received my aergrind on Monday, and it has a couple of issues. I've used the form on the website and the email address from the order confirmation email to try and get in touch with the company, but I've not received anything back yet. Does anyone have firsthand experience dealing with them - is it just a case of small business with few staff to deal with customer emails, or am I facing an uphill battle to get my issues resolved? 

Thanks all.",1614155532

Coffee,the-OG-darkshrreder,lr36no,Mocha making question,Hey so i just got a kcup machine and a milk frothier is on the way. But I’m looking to make /make something similar to a Starbucks caramel mocha w/ 2 shots espresso. I doubt I’ll be able to mimic it perfectly but still. Any advice is welcome and i have no idea what kcups to buy. I will probably buy a cheap caramel drizzle and milk and creamer. But I’m pretty sure i still need chocolate from somewhere to. Thanks in advance,1614139413

Coffee,JDWritesCode,lr2eka,Remineralization filter for coffee?,"After years of dealing with super hard funny-tasting tap water, I'm installing a reverse osmosis filter in our home, and need to choose a remineralization filter. Most of these filters are pretty vague on what minerals are being added back, or in what concentrations, so I'm wondering if anyone has experimented with this. Do some filters taste better for coffee, or are they all pretty much the same?

Here's what I've looked at so far:

* Frizzlife TAM3 ($29, replace every 12 months): Target TDS 10-30 ppm, which minerals??? Carbon filter.
* Everpure 7CC-BW ($85, replace every 6 months): Uses calcium carbonate
* Mineral Pro 700 ($69, replace every 12 months): Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium. Carbon filter.
* Optipure MA-Q15 ($90, replace every 6 months): Adds calcium / magnesium
* BWT Bestmin Premium M ($209, replace every 12 months): Adds magensium. Carbon filter.

Optipure / BWT seem to be more popular with coffee equipment resellers, but also the priciest.",1614136958

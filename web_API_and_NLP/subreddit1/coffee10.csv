I dont know which is better!
I know that Comandante is more expensive and higher-tier than JX PRO. but many people said they have the same results in a state of grinding.
I think if its true, there is no reason to buy Comandante. but If it is not true, after buying JX PRO, i will regret buying JX PRO instead of Comandante 

Whats ur opinion? Does JX PRO have the same grinding quality as Comandante regarding pour over?",1613225599

Coffee,Motalbaey,lj0hrn,Aeropress newb chasing grind size with Hario Mini Mill,"I've recently got offered an Aeropress and I'm having a bit of trouble finding a grind size/recipe that would work for something that could be used in a milk drink.

I've tried following James Hoffman's recipe in [this video](https://youtu.be/ZgIVfU0xBjA). Having only a Hario Mini Mill grinder and having read that it can't grind for esspresso I thought it would work well with the ""not quite esspresso fine but finer than supermarket preground coffee"" recomandation. 

So I went with a 3 click setting and it actually looked finer than in the aforementioned video. I brewed anyway following instructions and tasted before mixing as advised. I was expecting something harsh and bitter but oddly enough my cup felt way underextracted.  
Now I'm pretty new to coffee brewing having spent only a few months with a V60 so maybe my tastebuds aren't familiar enought with the taste but the coffee was extremely sour and acidic (which if I undersand correcty means it is underextracted ?). I've tried again with an even longer steep time (from 90s to 180s) and it was somehow the same but worse. 

Does any of you guys have experience with this setup ? Any advice would be welcome !

Also while looking for around for a solution I've stumbeld upon the [WAC Recepies](https://aeropress.com/championships/wac-recipes/) (thanks to [this video](https://youtu.be/pDznkxkdg2E) by The Real Sprometheus) and apparently they pretty much all use what seems to be a coarse grind, even for coffee that would be diluted, but there's no clue to what this actually looks like ?

He seemed to prefer the Kinu M47 for espresso, but ultimately dismissed them all as great for non-espresso. That wasn't helpful for us non-espresso drinkers, especially since he didn't mention the zpresso JX.

In this sub, many if us have purchased the Zpresso JX, the Comandante, the Helor 101, the Lido 3, etc. Are they really all the same for non-espresso, as Hoffman seemed to suggest?   If they're all roughly the same quality, why purchase anything other than the Zpresso JX or the timemore 60, since since they're the cheapest? For non-espresso drinkers, why did you choose the manual grinder you did? Do you feel like you made the right choice?

I ask because, like many of us here, I have a fear of missing out. I want to buy the best manual grinder for non-espresso, but it seems like they're all the same. That's sorta paralyzing.

The advice here helped me to keep grinding finer (despite manufacturer guidelines) until I found the sweet spot and to modify my process to avoid channelling which I didn't even know existed. So thanks folks. 

But as I was on a quest to solve my Chemex brew issue there was one thing I found that I just couldn't quite swallow, and that's the beans/water ratio factor. If one could get a great tasting brew in say a V60 or Kalita at 1:17, why would one want to waste more beans for another brew recipe/method that suggests 1:16 or less? Or am I missing something? Does it taste like an alltogether different animal? And yes I know taste is subjective, but any recipe I see that says to grind coarser and throw more beans at it I move on.

Every time I nail a brew and the aromas are jumping out of the mug, it seems like a missed opportunity to not focus those aromas even more with the shape of the mug.

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here; maybe it's problematic to drink a hot beverage out of a bowl-shaped vessel?

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to determine if I am having issues with the 'fines' in the grind or if my issue is my paper filter. Through my own research I saw running a lot of old coffee through the Ode can help so I did that with about a 1000 grams worth of coffee. Looking for any help or recommended adjustments.

   * Coffee: 30 g
   * Water: 500 mL
* Grind size: Medium
   * **Baratza Encore was set around 16 majority of the time**
   * **Fellow Ode was recommended 4 but I have made cups up to 8**
* Rinse paper filter 
* Add coffee grounds to V60 
* Start timer  at  0:00
* Add 2x coffee weight = 60 g of bloom water
* Bloom for up to 45 seconds  (0:45)
* Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight = 300 g in the next 30 seconds (1:15)
   * **This is where I start to see choke.** 
* Add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 seconds (1:45)
   * **I am unable to pour at this rate due to slow flow.**
* Stir 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon  This knocks off grounds from side wall  
* Allow V60 to drain a little 
* Give V60 a gentle swirl.
* Let brew drawdown. Aim to finish drawdawn by 3:30. 
   * **With the Encore I was seeing 3:15 to 3:30**
   * **With the Ode I am seeing 4:00 to 5:30.  Very over extracted**

I was just wondering whether people would recommend any commercial coffee machines?

I just posted this article about [What You Need To Know About Commercial Coffee Machines](https://www.batchcoffee.co.uk/stories/commercial-coffee-machine) and I was thinking about including some machine recommendations.

I have worked on numerous machines in Australia and the UK like La Marzocco's, Wega, Slayer, etc but I'd love to hear some more ideas from coffee people/baristas around the world.

Coffee,MirroredFreak,liai58,Coffee machine recommendation,"Hey there,

so currently I'm using a pretty cheap coffee machine from philips. It was okay at the beginning but a few things are annoying. Its really really loud (especially if you do milk foam) and the coffee is mediocre at best.

My first plan was just to buy a newer/better coffee machine like the nivona 820 or something similar.  
But the more I look the more confused I get.  


Maybe first my drinking behavior:  
Most of the times I just drink one coffee (with milk) for breakfast (everyday). If I feel fancy I drink two or something with milk foam. But mostly just plain coffee with a shot milk.  


A few friends recommended me a espresso machines with a separate grinder. I kind of like the thought of that, but Im not sure if its useful if Im most of the time drink plain coffee.

So before I get too deep in the jungle of coffee machines I thought I seek help from you.  


My budget is around 800‚Ç¨.

Thanks in advance and stay healthy!",1613134648

Coffee,hamzez,li9dc3,Caffeine!,"  

Im not sure if this should go as a post or if it fits into the question thread but:  
 

Caffeine!

I know calculating the caffeine content in different types of coffee is so variable because there is SO many factors to consider. I‚Äôve been recently getting into coffee A LOT more and I tend to switch over to caffeine free after my first two cups of coffee. (I generally use the Aeropress for now) I‚Äôve always counted for caffeine content in things just to make sure im not overdoing it or getting TOO addicted. Since I work out, I like to have a cup 30-60min before my workout but on somedays I don‚Äôt feel any different and somedays it hits like a rush. I generally use the same brew methods and grind size and beans with either just the original allan adler quick brew method(30-45s) or use an inverted method which makes the total brew time 1-2min.  
 

My question is which factors matter the most in terms of caffeine extraction? Obviously if you use more beans, you‚Äôll have a higher caffeine content but would grinding finer or coarser have any effect? Would brewing for longer have a bigger effect, let‚Äôs say if you did a pour over on a v60 or a French press for example? What would be a top and low end of caffeine content in light roasted, medium roast, dark roast arabica beans just to have a general idea of a limit?

I realize answering question about caffeine in coffee is not that simple so my question is more leaning towards do any of you have any research or blogs, articles, informative reddit posts that has studied these things and have answers for some of them which gvies a bigger insight on caffeine content in different brewing method, grind size, time, heat ect ect..?

Do you have a general rule of thumb that you go by when it comes to counting your own daily caffeine consumption when drinking coffee and if so what did you base that metod on? 

I‚Äôd like to get more insight on this, so I‚Äôd appreciate your help :D",1613129942

Coffee,Final-Equipment-3776,li7mup,Upgrading my Coffee Machine (Advice needed),"My current coffee machine is a really cheap, Tschibo ""QBO"" Capsule Maschine. I know, I know... but it basically made me go from hating coffee to absolutely enjoying at least one or two cups a day. After owning this machine for over two years it's finally time for an upgrade. But there are so many different kinds of machines out there and I have no idea which one to choose. 

I narrowed it down to 3 Models: the SAGE Barista Express, the Siemens EQ.6 Plus S100I or a (insert random Delonghi/Krups machine here)

Are these good Machines? I do not want so spend more than 600‚Ç¨ and I mostly drink Caffe with milk (Espresso not that much) - So the Milk aspect is kinda important to me. That said, I realized that there's a lot of different methods how to foam the milk (some machines have it integrated, some have this funny looking thing that foams your milk (I have no idea how thats called!)

I am well aware that the coffee beans I choose make a big difference when it comes to the quality of the coffee. But I still would like to get a nice machine that does the job and is well built! 

So, what would you recommend me? I am open to everything! :)

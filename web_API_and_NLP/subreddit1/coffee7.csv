Wife wants the convenience of an automatic one. It needs to heat the milk, too. If it's not self contained and hassle free frankly she won't use it, so no manual frothers, steam wands, etc. 

I see the new Secura 4 in 1 is about $55 right now on Amazon, and the Capresso is about the same price. How do y'all think they compare, and are the Aeroccino 4 and Breville frothers really so much better as to be worth being 1.5-2x the price?",1613717710

I used to be a novice with coffee. However, I‚Äôve recently learned about all of the carcinogens and different chemicals that can be found in cheaper coffees. 

For a while now, I‚Äôve been drinking organic and fair trade coffees and have been enjoying them. But, I‚Äôm not going to lie, I really miss having a cup of flavored coffee every now and then.

The only issue with this is flavored coffees tend to be the most carcinogenic and unhealthy. Just yesterday, I grabbed a bag of Maple Brown Sugar flavored coffee from ALDI as a splurge. Alas, I can‚Äôt drink it without feeling a tad guilty/gross.

Do any of you have any recommendations for ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù flavored coffees? Please share! Thank you.

Coffee,teitelez,lmzldi,Bialetti Moka Pot Questions,"Hi coffee drinkers,

I have a 3 cup aluminum Moka Express and 6 cup stainless steel Musa. Both make great coffee and have been in service for 10 and 5 years respectively. I have a question that perhaps coffee people smarter than me know the answer to...

**When I brew in the smaller aluminum maker, the coffee flows out of the spout very slowly, steadily, with lots of bubbles (foam) - almost espresso-like. With the larger steel Musa, the coffee flows pretty steadily, but sputters a little more, and has hardly any bubbles (which dissipate quickly). Why the difference? I'm guessing something to do with water volume to pressure ratio? Or perhaps the heat conductivity of aluminum and steel?**  

My recipe for each is the same and pretty standard: boiling water in the reservoir, slightly coarser than espresso grind, no tamping, just level off the full basket, medium heat on the gas range, coffee is ready in similar times in both pots - about 30-60 seconds... now that think of it, I don't know why this brewing time isn't different given the different sizes...

And just to be clear, the coffee is great from both - I don't actually want to change my brewing method - I am just curious as to the difference of foam in the pot makers (and I now why the brewing time is more or less the same)

I love the Aeropress, but I've been recently drawn back to the idea of a pour over.  The last one I had was a big 8-cup Chemex which I enjoyed, but rarely got to use.  I'd also like to downsize a bit in my apartment, so I was curious as to people's opinions on the Chemex 3 cup for double-duty on being able to make enough for one or two cups.

Coffee,kruzman20,lmworn,Gaggia Brera - calibration,"My next door neighbor gave me his.  I was not looking for one.  I am not as into coffee as some people, but I do respect you guys that are and learned from you enough to buy myself an aeropress and was happy with it.  I also had a little experience with making espressos when the tech company I worked for bought a $9K machine and I was making a couple a day while at work, and learned how good coffee could taste.  I never achieved that with the aeropress but that was to be expected.

So the next door neighbor offered me his Gaggia Brera and I figured why not.  I have been struggling to get a decent espresso from it.  I've tried different strengths from the one bean, two bean, three bean settings on the front and tried different grinds from the grind setting knob on top.  Also tried light, medium and dark roast beans. 

Also I've cleaned the main mechanism and also opened it and cleaned the grind wheel.  But it never makes a flavorful coffee or espresso.  It creates a crema foam but the espressos are not thick and flavorful.

My latest theory is that it is not grinding the coffee well.  After it makes a shot it expels a puck into a container and I have examined the output of fine grain, medium and coarse and I hardly see any difference.  (picture attached)   I would think that I should a big difference.  I don't have a burr grinder at home but when I put a bag of coffee through the grinder at a supermarket I can see a large difference in the output of the dry coffee depending on the grind settings.   When I examine the used pucks from the Brera after they have dried out I don't see much size difference.   It makes me think that the Brera may not be grinding correctly.  

I did a chat session with a Gaggia store and learned that I need to calibrate it by running a bunch of shots but that doesn't seem like a process that will fix the fact that the grinds are not much different between the fine and coarse settings.  

Does anybody have any experience with this machine and can guide me through this?  The chat session with the store was pointing me toward probably needing to send it in.  (they did send me instructions for running a calibration but they don't seem to make sense.)   I don't want to send in the machine because of the expense.  I could probably buy a burr grinder and maybe manual espresso machine for the cost I suspect it would be to get the Brera repaired/calibrated.",1613680970

Coffee,gooneyleader,lmsv44,Everyone always asks about how I make my Large Batch Cold Brew....Well Here ya go.,"This is a great way to make  large batch cold brew at home with little investment and just a bit of time. This method can make anywhere from 2 gallons to 10 plus gallons. Great for the spring and Summer months, also great to giveaway to friends and family as a gift.  

1) Buy some Nut milk bags off of amazon. Its basically a giant reusable filter bag that all the coffee will sit in while its brewing. 

2) Buy your coffee. Fresher the better. Do not buy pre-ground coffee. Grind for Coarse. I use about a half pound of coffee per gallon of water. I usually cant afford it but I try and get the big 5lb bag of Hair Bender from Stumptown. Not the cheapest, but its hands down the best. 

3) Using a large pot, put your ground coffee in the nut milk bag and add appropriate amount of water. You can even make ""concentrate"" style cold brew or ""half-caf"", make to your liking. 

4) Let steep for 24-48 hours. Agitate the bag by moving it up and down in  the pot. Do this several times through out the brew cycle before dumping the ground coffee. Once the you pull the bag out let the container sit for 12 hours, do not agitate the container. 

5) After 12 hours you can carefully pour the  brew into mason jars or gallon jugs. If your a perfectionist you can buy some food grade brew line hose and syphon the clean brew until you hit the sludge.  Expect some loss at the bottom of the pot and toss sludge in the yard. Your done!",1613671337

Coffee,alorne85,lmp7qe,Moccamaster KB741 vs. other SCA Home Brewers - Purchase advice needed,"Hey all,

I thought I had found the right automatic home brewer (Moccamaster KB741) but after reading countless posts about Moccamasters, I'm not sure if it's the *one* anymore.

For context, I've been making coffee daily with a V60 for five or more years and I'm just a little bored of the process. I like the coffee I get from it but I'd also love something I can switch on and walk away from. The other reason for wanting an automatic machine is because when guests are over in the future I'd like to be able to make a batch of coffee instead of slowly making pour-overs one-by-one.

What stood out to me about the MM is that it's simple, it's SCA certified, it has a good warranty, it's easy to get replacement parts, and it feels like a buy-it-once purchase; plus it looks cool. What I keep seeing in other posts is that in order to get a good cup, you need to intervene so that you get even saturation of the grounds. If I don't do that, and assuming that I'm using good beans that are well ground, will it still produce good coffee? It seems weird that the MM would get the SCA certification if you have to do these manual hacks to achieve good results. Or does the SCA certification not actually mean that much?

Currently I only brew 400ml of coffee with the V60. If I do a similar size batch with the MM, will I have less of an issue with the even saturation since there will be less coffee in the basket? I decided on the KB741 because it has the different flow options and would work better for smaller batches.

Is anyone else in a similar position? Are you happy with just turning on the MM and letting it brew? If you're not happy with the MM, what brewer did you get or wish you got instead?

I'm not trying to win any awards with this coffee. I just want it to taste good without obsessing over it.

Coffee,Number5is_ALIVE,lmh1zy,Beginner Questions: Would love some help,"I have done lots of research and am about where I need to be for a drip maker. 

1. We essentially want 2g of coffee per oz ideally it seems. That is say 12g for 6oz of water into the machine, not how much actually makes it into the cup, like 4-5oz right? 

2. I fear the crappy single serve maker I bought doesn‚Äôt make the water hot enough. Seems to be about 170-180 and I read 195-205 is ideal. I‚Äôve done reading after reading but the best single serves are insanely expensive and I fear 5-8-12 cup models won‚Äôt handle what I want. A single occasional cup of decaf. 

3. Would it be easier for me; a single serve guy to learn to do a proper pour over - and is there any difference in flavor? 

I have my grinder. I have finally found my favorite beans. I just need to get this acidic flavor that comes from my crappy one outputting 175 water to the delicious perfection of the old 12 cupper of my FIL‚Äôs I had to jerry rig to make produce one cup which is doing about 200 degrees.",1613633941

I‚Äôve been using my encore for drip, French press, and clever dripper for a while now, never really needing to go below like setting 10.  

I just bought a moka pot to try out some faux-spresso, should be here tomorrow. All the moka pot videos I‚Äôve watched on YouTube recommend grinding as fine as you can on grinders like the Encore (ie entry level grinders that can‚Äôt really do espresso). Just to experiment I dialed all the way down to 0 and tried to grind some beans, but nothing came out at all. I didn‚Äôt get anything until I got up to like 5 or 6.  

Is this normal?  Do you have to like grind on 40 first and then on 0 so the coarse grounds can actually fit into the burrs?

I didn‚Äôt hear any horrible grinding sounds so I don‚Äôt think the burrs are touching each other or anything like that.

Coffee,coldpav,lmbe48,V60 v Me: Round 1,"It was 2:30 in the afternoon and I was determined to claim victory over the V60 which had been sitting in my cupboard for the past week, mocking me as it gathered dust. Finally I would push open the gates to Coffee Land, a magical place of Reddit coffee snobs preaching about Ethiopians and third wave baristas that could stare me down until I confessed to my previous Starbucks sins - I would belong at last.

I set to work - gathered my scale (with my phone as my simultaneous timer), my kettle (not gooseneck), and some decent medium roast (freshly ground on medium-fine). Having watched the Holy Grail (Hoffman's Technique), with one of the top comments instructing me word for word, I was prepared. I hoped the coffee grounds couldn't smell my fear.

Reader, my first mistake was when I poured in the coffee grounds into the filter... and I had maybe 3 mm of space left to the top of the filter. *It's fine,* I thought, *all the water will still fit*. *I can still swirl as beautifully as James.*

It was not fine. 

I actually managed to pour in 2x the coffee weight in the first 30s, but after this all hope was lost. My flow rate was not limited by 8 g/s, but rather the painstaking slowness at which the bed drained. I observed dejectedly as water overflowed the filter and ran down the sides of the V60 and despaired as I reached 60% of the total brew weight in t = 2:30. **This phase is critical!** the comment berated me. How I wished I could apologise.

As I finished my brew by t = 4:45, I realised I had lost my first battle with Mr. Hario. My punishment? The murky, blacker than black coffee that seemed to suck all the surrounding light in.  Bitter, bitter, bitter - the angelic nutty cocoa and ethereal stone fruit notes must have flown off in disgrace.

Weariness becomes me. The fight for Coffee Land will continue tomorrow, after I have recuperated my resources (e.g., the will to live).

The first time I brew from a new bag of coffee it always seems to come out great. Full bodied, balanced flavors, perfect extraction. As soon as the next day up to a week or two that I‚Äôm brewing that coffee the quality declines, sometimes significantly, to almost undrinkable. This is without any change in brewing parameters. It‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm under or over extracting on subsequent brews but the quality definitely declines. 

I‚Äôve heard that grinding coarser and up-dosing should help but I‚Äôve had mixed results. Anyone have similar issues and how do you deal with it?

Current brew setup is: 
Brewer: Breville precision brewer using pour over attachment with a V60. 30 second bloom time. 205 degree water. 1:16 ratio (30 g coffee to 480 g water)

Grinder: Breville smart grinder pro, typically medium/drip grind size around setting 45-48 

Coffee: typically light/medium roast single origins from local roasters 

Coffee storage: vacuum sealed container, protected from light. 

This is my current setup but I‚Äôve had this issue with multiple brew methods. I often switch between my automatic drip to V60 or clever brewer. Any advice is appreciated.",1613594332

I realized my grounds were falling out of the holes at the bottom. So I coursened the grind up a bit and proceeded. I used a Nicaragua el Pastoral from a roaster in my city which I like a lot, about 18g (but really measured by volume due to the nature of the moka pot) and preheated my water in the pot. The end result was super sour, which I know means underextracted and a good solution is usually to fine up the grind.... but going finer and I'll start having the issue that the basket doesn't hold the coffee anymore.

Coffee,jaydway,lm2oup,Frustrating inconsistency even with Clever,"I started to get really frustrated with getting a consistently good cup of coffee from my V60. I've also got a Clever dripper, and used to have a really hard time getting decent cups out of that too, until I realized recently I was just grinding too coarse. Since I realized I can grind a lot finer, I started actually getting really good cups out of the Clever, and decided I'd rather not fuss over the V60 and just get an easy, consistently good cup of coffee with the Clever.

But, the more I use the Clever, the more I still encounter inconsistency. I've been following Hoffmann's technique of grinding somewhat finer, water at boiling, pouring water first then grounds, stir the top till there's no more chunks of dry coffee at the top, let it sit for 2+ minutes, stir (and/or sometimes shake) and let sit for 30 seconds, then drain. Sometimes I get pretty tasty cups. The first cup out of this new bag of Ethiopian from Coava was incredible. The second cup was slightly less. Every cup since then has been mediocre to plain bad. My grind size has been more or less the same, with only small experimentations one or two clicks on either end, using my Encore with M2 burr set.

Isn't the Clever supposed to be super consistent? What the heck is going on? Why is it that the first cup from this bag was one of the best cups of this particular coffee from Coava I've ever had, but I can't get the same flavor in any other cup since? I don't understand what can be changing so much to give such different flavor if I'm essentially doing the same thing every time.",1613590635

I recently purchased a Comandante and am experiencing some static with some beans I’ve just gotten. I’m contemplating using the RDT but was curious if anyone has experienced any negatives while using the technique with the Comandante. Has it caused any maintenance issues for anyone?

The blades, the threaded shaft, and all.  Now, I have not seen any cleaning or repair guides detail this happening. After sliding it back in, it is nowhere near the calibration it was. Actually, the burrs run into each other near the fine setting. I cannot find any guide or way to get that inner burr further in.

Coffee,SlyBox,lxucmr,Horibble/no customer service from Bodum,"Over the past year I started to really appreciate a good cup of coffee and have upgraded to what I think is a pretty good starter setup compared to the pre ground Kirkland stuff I was brewing before.

One of my first pieces I bought to knock my coffee game up a couple of notches was a grinder. Since this was my first piece I didn't want to break the bank so I went with the modestly priced Bodum Bistro Bur Grinder. All in all the grinder was pretty great considering I spent only about $70 on it. It worked good enough for me at the time and would get daily use.

Fast forward to 10 months later - I pop some beans in and hear the motor whirring but the burr isn't spinning. I figure since this fell within the one year period I'd be fine getting a warranty replacement.

I emailed Bodum with the warranty request and waited. 1 week went by, no reply. I then sent a second email, 3 days go by and still no reply.

I figure they're busy so I wait a full 2 weeks before trying to reach out to them again. This time I reach out on their instagram page. This time I get a message back asking for my email. Great! I'm finally getting somewhere. Nope. Nothing comes of this. So I message again...and again. Nothing. At this point I now go to their Facebook page and message them to which they respond asking which country I'm in, I tell them. And guess what..no reply. 

It's now been almost 3 weeks and I haven't even had my issue acknowledged. This is beyond frustrating.

Since I needed a grinder I hit the forums for suggestions and one that popped up as a good starter grinder was the Baratza Encore. I've heard great things about the quality of their product and how good their customer service is which I'm now realizing how important it is to value when buying a product.

Here's to hoping it's smooth sailing with the Baratza as I'm vowing never to purchase another Bodum product.",1614889649

Coffee,MSmithRD,lxrhrd,Are there coffee makers/pots that have the convenience of a Keurig?,"Hey folks,

I'm looking for a single cup coffee maker, that has a tall water reservoir for like 10 cups of coffee and that I can put in an entire lb of beans (preferably whole beans).  Then, I just put my cup under it, hit single cup button, and it'll use just enough beans and water for 1 cup.  Water is already hot so it comes out quick.  My work office had this, but it's clearly a commercial machine that probably costs hundreds if not thousands.  Anything like this in the residential market?  I've seen single cup coffee makers with water reservoir, but I believe you have to add the beans every time you want to make a cup (it's hard to tell though so I'm not sure).  Basically I want both a water and a bean reservoir, so that every time I make coffee, it's just a single click, similar to the convenience of a Keurig.

Coffee,tdrr12,lxq8dn,What equipment should I buy when I only want to pull two consistently decent double shots every day? (No steaming / frothing required!),"Hi /r/Coffee,

I've read through your (quite helpful) wiki, but would really appreciate some more specific equipment recommendations as my equipment demands probably differ quite a bit from the average consumer.

**Equipment demands**: Two double-shots of espresso, about 5 hours apart. No frothing, no other drinks -- I haven't used the steam wand on my current machine once in \~10 years (except when cleaning/descaling). While I am into really good espresso, I am also a big fan of convenience and hope I don't have to waste too much energy having a machine be on and/or pre-heating for a long time.

**Current setup**: Gaggia Classic that I tricked out over time (PID mod and aftermarket improvement parts)  + Gaggia MDF Grinder (w/ stepless mod). I have had this setup for \~10 years now and have probably replaced about half of the machine during that time (yay for easily available parts!), but feel like it's time for an upgrade. A good amount of research went into that purchase a decade ago, but my knowledge of the coffee equipment world hasn't been updated since and seems woefully outdated now.

**Budget (machine plus grinder):** Ideally $1,500, absolute max $3,000.

I'm not averse to buying used (I've acquired some great kitchen equipment via CL or restaurant auctions) and doing some rehab / repair myself. I would really appreciate any suggestions!",1614879297

For the past week I've been drinking the same coffee every morning, prepared the same way, but today I had a donut with it.  I started eating the donut first, then sipped my coffee and thought ""What is this??  Did I really mess up the Aeropress recipe that much??"".  The coffee tasted so smoky, not at all how it normally tastes.  I finished my donut and kept drinking, and the coffee slowly started to change back to how it normally tastes; no more extreme smoky flavor.  These beans definitely have a slight smokiness to them, but it's never overpowering.  I guess the sweetness of the donut allowed the smokiness of the coffee to come through even more so than normal.  Good thing I didn't dump my cup out halfway through the donut!",1614867641

- 10s extraction 🤦‍♀️
- grind size 9
- 16g of espresso
- perfect pressure (12oclock on the pressure gauge)

Now 11g is already too much, but it is definitely not looking like much in the single shot basket. If I go finer it will mean that I wont even have enough coffee to tamp it unless I use more than 11g... which brings me to my question - is there a smaller basket for the same portafilter?

Coffee,Elbycloud,lww15k,Delonghi EC155 fix with gorilla glue seems to be working,"I have a one-year-old EC 155 espresso maker, and the upper boiler runners fell off last month. I kept sticking them back on there with a knife until finally one of the little feet broke off and the coffee started spilling out the sides of the upper boiler when I pulled. I looked it up and you can replace the entire upper boiler, but not just the two little rubber feet, which is tedious, time consuming, and involved buying the entire part.

You can barely see the black runners on the bottom and it took me ages to figure out how to replace them since they don’t appear in the schema. 

I figured I’d give gorilla glue a try, and although perhaps it is leeching into my coffee, I don’t notice it and it’s working! So far it’s been a week and they haven’t fallen out and I haven’t had any mysterious illnesses.

Coffee,PrettyBigChief,lwuz3v,Timecore C2 too small?,"I am new to all of this fancy coffee stuff. I apologize for my tone but this morning was pretty flippin disappointing.

I've been using a spinny-blade grinder for, oh, 20 years or so. Ordered a Timemore C2 on Amazon. I waited with massive anticipation at how this one thing might change my pour-over experience (the V2 is on the way).

I have always put 4 scoops (\~30g) of beans into my grinder. The Timemore holds all of 3, and barely at that. I didn't bother weighing them. I emptied it and went back to the spinny-blade, anticipating returning the C2.

Any advice before I box this $85 waste of money up and ship it back? Do I just need to do multiple fill/grind/empty cycles for one cup of coffee?

Edit: Yeah, it's a Time**more.** Rough morning.",1614781225

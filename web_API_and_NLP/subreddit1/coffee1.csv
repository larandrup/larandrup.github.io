Coffee,nelldog,lwr3z9,A large batch aeropress recipe that I wanted to share.,"Hi all just wanted to share with you a larger batch technique I've been using that's been working really well.

Dose: 30g

Grind: Medium (On the Wilfa Svart I have it set to the A or Aeropress if that helps)

Aeropress: Standard configuration

Brew time: 2 minutes.

(Hotel: Trivago)

Technique:

1. After all the rinsing and preheating has been done to both aeropress and carafe. Add first 50g of just off the boil water, and stir for 10 seconds.
2. Add a further 150g of water and put the plunger on, lifting it slightly to create suction and stoping any coffee from dripping.
3. Leave to brew for 90 seconds.
4. After 90 seconds, take plunger off and break crust on top with the back of a spoon.
5. Place plunger and...well plunge. My timing have been around 10 seconds for this.
6. This should yield around 160g of coffee concentrate, add to this 200-250g of water with the aim of bringing the over all liquid amount to 400g.
7. Swirl, pour, let cool and enjoy.

Pretty simple but has been really effective and has made me fall in love with my Aeropress all over again. Let me know what you think and even share how you've been brewing.",1614768857

Coffee,MrTorpedo77,lwo8cl,"Coffee noob here, someone please enlighten me (Philz fan)."," So I just started drinking coffee a year ago and went from Starbucks cold brew with almond milk to Philz Tesora no sugar, light cream which felt like a revelation.  I get that coffee purists dont rate Philz on the upper tier since it's seems like their popularity is derived from their heavy cream/sugar based options which I've tried and admit are delicious but im health conscious so I prefer my coffee black with a bit of cream.  Lots of coffee purists also infer that Philz uses a a heavy manufacturing cream and blend of 2nd rate coffee beans etc. 

     It seems like a common recommendation is Blue bottle etc.  I live in LA and was just wondering if anyone can point me out to a retail coffee vendor that replicates this Philz Tesora but better? I've sampled some of the brands that coffee purists praise but I dont like bitter or acidic coffee but love the carmel chocolate nutty taste profile of Philz Tesora!  Obviously I don't really know how much of this is coming from the heavy cream which I choose the light option which settles on the top.

    The only thing I've ever tried that came close was at the Bouchon bakery kiosk in the Venetian in Las Vegas (Americano) which was the tk expresso blend from Equator coffee.",1614757087

So my gf bought this cold brew maker? Brewer? Recently and I dove into making cold brew for her. However my forte is espresso and drip.

However it aonly producing 2 cups per brew and I realized that 100g of coffee for 2 cups is crazy. I've got to be over dosing the basket or serving her concentrated cold brew. Am I doing this wrong?

Coffee,BigxBadxBeetleborgx,lwfrss,Looking to get a new grinder,"With how hard it is to snag a Niche I am taking my money into something I can get NOW. 

My current set up is embarrassing to say the least. I have a blade grinder that I use every morning for a Chemex pour over. I'm officially over it, time to move on. 

I brew appox 50g to 900ml every morning for the wife and I. The amount of coffee I make only changes when we have guests and I have to make multiple batches. I hardly ever make less. 

With this said I would love to get into espresso as we just got our plumbing re-done and there is a spot for the future espresso machine to be plumbed into. Now when I purchase the espresso machine it will probably be 6 months out, so the simple pour over is still in play over here. 

I have been looking at all sorts of grinders for so long, and well I kinda have it narrowed down, but I wanted to ask a question I have had a hard time finding the answer to. Would it be crazy to just buy a Eureka Specialita now and use it specifically for pour over? I would not be going back and forth between grind settings and just be using it for pour-over. That is until the espresso machine comes. Then I will just use the Specialita for espresso and probably end up buying an Encore or Lido for my occasional pour-overs that I know I will still make. I understand the Specialita is made for espresso and will produce fines, but would it be okay to use soley for pour-over until the time comes and it graduates into espressohood? Or would my money be better spent getting something like say, an encore or ode now? I kinda want to jump on getting the Specialita now but I wanted to hear some opinions if anyone has used it for brewing coffee regularly. TIA",1614728385

Honestly those beans were pretty tough, but I can't imagine them being tougher than metal. Also the burrs weren't touching each other because there's absolutely no resistance when it's empty.

I've also looked at the sage barista express which looks very similar , but is priced at 580 Vs this breville machine at 420.. it seems breville in UK/IRL is not the same as breville elsewhere in the world which is all very confusing.

Coffee,Jaywalkas,lw85re,Bad Experience With Whole Latte Love,"  

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share my experience with WLL to maybe warn others going into this as well as maybe to help commiserate with others who've maybe had similar experiences .As I write this review/summary of my experience I will try to stay as objective as possible despite my frustrations.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I (both former baristas at one point in our life) decided that it’s a good time for us to get our own espresso machine for home. Originally our budget was set at around $200 but after doing a ton of research and considering what we want in a machine we bumped that up to around $300 ($330 was the final price) to put us in reach of a refurbished Gaggia Classic. It checked all of the boxes for us: non-pressurized portafilter, ability to use pods, ability to customize and upgrade in the future, etc. I spent some time waiting for either a refurbished Classic or Classic Pro in our price range to hit the market through either Amazon Warehouse or Whole Latte Love. WLL was the first to put one up for offer and I jumped on it. Order went through on Feb 4th. It arrived Feb 11th and during that time we ordered beans from our favorite roaster in Seattle and had them shipped in (we live fairly rural in the Cascade Mountains), purchased shot glasses, milk (we don’t really keep milk in house), oatmilk, espresso pods, and a frothing pitcher. We’re ready (yes, a nice grinder would have been next on the list).

&amp;#x200B;

I unpack the machine and start putting it together. I know it’s a refurb but I’m fairly disappointed in some of the rusty or calcified components, especially ones that could/should have been easily replaced (looking at you rusty screws!) during the refurbishing process. The rust on the body is understandably harder to remove. Ignoring this I continue to put it together and try it out. Steam works okay and pump primes but nearly no water flows through the brew assembly. I get about 1oz after a minute thirty seconds. I take apart the brew assembly and it’s dirty, screws are calcified, but screen looks good even though it’s worn a bit and there doesn’t seem to be any obstructions. Take the top off and look for anything loose or out of place. All good. Just no water really from the brew group. Can’t make espresso. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I call customer service on Feb 12th, the tech sends out a blind portafilter and Cafiza so I can back flush the brew group on the 15th. It arrives on the 24th. My poor beans. I immediately set everything back up and start backflushing the unit. Still minimal water flow. I continue backflushing and checking for nearly an hour with no improvement. Done.

&amp;#x200B;

Customer service call again on Feb 24th. They tell me there’s a replacement machine on hold but the senior tech wants to reach out to me in a day or two to see if there’s any last ditch effort to be made before replacing the machine and I should expect an email or call in around 24-48 hours. Nothing. No attempt on their part to reach out to me until I call back on March 1st. Apparently there’s no record of a work ticket for the senior tech to reach out to me even though that was their idea. I am very frustrated at this point and it’s been nearly a month since I ordered. I tell the rep that I would like to just exchange it at this point. They talk it over with their manager and tell me that there is actually no machine available to exchange and that my only options are to send it back for a refund or to fix it myself. So I will now be spending more of my time packing it up and sending it back and waiting for a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I will not be reimbursed for my time trying to do the service tech’s job. I ordered a working product. It is not my job to fix a product that was supposed to arrive in working order. If I wanted to take a gamble on a product I would have bought it from a garage sale and spent half as much. If I wanted a project I would have gone to Ebay and bought one that needed fixing for half as much. I went to Whole Latte Love because they are supposed to be a reputable company and I expected a working product. I expected that I would be covered in the event that this product did not work. I am not a repair technician for Whole Latte Love and it’s unfair to ship me a product that doesn’t work and expect me to be a repair technician for Whole Latte Love and not get paid for it. It’s unfair and frustrating for me as a consumer. This is a failure to deliver a working product and a failure to rectify the situation.

Does anyone have any advice or has run into this problem with ceramic brewers? Not sure if this is a technique thing or what the problemo is.

I am using a buono kettle and have been brewing 30g of coffee to 450-480g of water depending on the coffee.

Coffee,JazzyDoots,ltyvlc,What is the point of steamed milk in/on coffee? (Newbie question),"Hello! I just recently got into coffee, and I'm trying to learn more about it; it's process, how to make a good cup, what the different roasts do to the flavor, etc. I don't know too much about it yet. 

I have a family member who is a big coffee person (which is how I got into it) and they have a Jura E8 coffee maker. That's how I started on coffee, just went straight into a Sumatra dark roast with the coffee option (I love the flavor of the Sumatra, very earthy! Haven't tried anything else yet tho.) I just use the ""coffee"" option, I don't try to get too fancy. I'm not really a fan of the steamed milk that you can do on the machine for the espresso and macchiatos. I hope I'm not commuting a cardinal sin by questioning it, but what is the point of the steamed milk? Does it add texture or something like that? I've yet to find a clear answer to what it does to the coffee or if it does anything. It seems like a novelty in a way, by putting fluffy milk on strong coffee. 

I mostly don't like the steamed milk bc I don't get it's purpose. What does steamed milk do? Am I a heretic for just enjoying plain Jane coffee? Also, what advice would you give to a beginner coffee drinker? Thanks!",1614464805

Coffee,amdufrales,ltwczv,"Just upgraded my grinder.... oh my lord, what I’ve been missing! (Rave post)","(LONG)

Just thought I’d share this anecdote about my pursuit of a better cup, from one cheapskate to other potential under-cutters out there.

For Christmas last year (14 months ago) my folks teamed up to buy me a Technivorm Moccamaster. I don’t know what model exactly, but it has a glass carafe with 10-cup capacity and it’s all brushed stainless steel. Totally gorgeous. The kind of thing I would never have spent the money on for myself, and I thanked them up and down — I truly use it and enjoy it every single day, even more than a year after getting it.

Now, about my proclivity for being a cheapskate: I routinely treat myself with nice stuff, and I buy nice gifts for family when occasions come around. But I have trouble justifying certain things that actually ARE worth spending money on, and it gets kind of foolish — but more to the point, here, when I first received my Moccamaster I cheaped out on a coffee grinder and purchased a $60 Krups model thinking it would do justice to this $300+ brewer and $15 bags of beans. And of course it didn’t. Thanks to the brewer and bean quality I was getting, it was still the best coffee I’d ever made at home, but not on par with what I’d expect in a pricey café, or like in my old employer’s office where multiple coffee-heads conspired to supply us with pricey beans for the Baratza Encore and high-end Bunn brewing setup. 

One week ago, my Krups failed me for the last time. It would begin to grind beans from the hopper only to slow and jam up, making a loud buzzing sound. After multiple disassembles, cleanings and troubleshooting sessions failed to solve the issue, I contacted the warranty team at Krups to get my money back and poured that refund (plus a bag of Stumptown beans) into OXO’s $99 conical burr grinder. 

All I can say is holy cow, I feel like an idiot, and I wish I’d bought this grinder (or something of similar quality) right off the bat. I managed to dial in the grind size and volume pretty well on the first try, and my first brew this morning made former batches from the Moccamaster seem totally worthless in comparison. I finally feel like I’m reaching some of the potential the brewer itself is worth — it’s inspiring me to use my Kalita 185 and Chemex more often to get an even better sense of the grind capabilities, and make the most out of more consistent and controllable grinding. 

The good news is that my Moccamaster is really only “broken in” after 300+ brew cycles, primed to enjoy for years to come; I guess the process I’ve gone through here is almost akin to when you drink your first sixer of Budweiser, think that’s not half bad, and then months later someone introduces you to a craft saison that blows your mind. Here I was thinking I was making fine coffee, and now I shake my head at the swill produced by more primitive (pound-foolish) efforts from my year-long amateur hour. 

Don’t be like me, folks — invest a bit, buy for quality, and do justice to your expensive beans, your pretty brewer, your hand-crafted Chemex or sexy stainless Kalita. You (and your equipment) deserve the payoff.",1614456981

I’ve recently made the jump into grinding/brewing my own coffee beans instead of just buying ready made coffee at the store. 

For a while I really enjoyed the taste of the medium/dark roast blue bottle of La Colombe. I’m guessing in beans it would be their “Bleu” product. (Dark roast beans: cocoa, macadamia, sweet cream) 

Is there alternatives to this product/brand? I’d say it’s worth the price 100% but I’m in a spot right now where it’s probably not smart to spend $20-$30 (according to amazon) on coffee beans. So looking for a reasonable alternative until I can splurge and treat myself to La Colombe once more!

The thing that I found really interesting is that the brew guides all emphasize heavy center pours, purposely trying to attain a valley in the coffee bed. I watched their video and compared it to Hoffman's V60 guide and its pretty much contradictory in every way. Has anyone used Onyx's method with success? I tried it a couple times and the results were okay, but I definitely felt like extraction was less even because of how drastic the deep valley in the coffee bed was, and at the end of the draw down I don't have the near perfectly flat coffee bed that I have with the Hoffman one.",1614441724
Coffee,Existing-Pizza-9288,ltqwd9,Awful water...great coffee. I don't get it.,"My grandfather built his house over an artesian well sometime in the 1920s.  Fast forward to the 1970s when I was first offered coffee as a teenager.  Percolated in a Corningware stovetop percolator with pre-ground Eight O'clock arabica coffee purchased at the grocery store, it was the best, never since duplicated coffee experience I have ever had.  The water used was VILE.  That well water was actually tinted grey with iron and had the most terrible rotten egg smell.  ""Drink this, it's really healthy for you!"" my brother would say.  I couldn't drink it and could hardly even stand to bathe in it.  So how did my grandmother make such divine coffee (and tea) with such vile water with no filtration? She was a simple farm woman (a top notch seamstress and cook) and certainly did not have access to a lot of the mod cons we enjoy today.  She broke every single rule of coffee making that were touted even in 1950s cook books (you should have seen the inside of the percolator - eek!) and yet still made memorable coffee.

Coffee,0x1mason,ltq2xq,Quietish espresso grinder for multi-gen fam,"I bought the Baratza Sette 30 and it is too loud for my wife and 7 yo son. Otherwise seems like a good fit for us, but I am going to have to get something else. I would love some suggestions for grinders that satisfy the following constraints. Listed in order of importance:

- Must be multi-gen friendly. My FIL, who is almost 80, lives with us and drinks drip. The machine needs to be simple enough that he can easily change the grind setting for his coffee and we can change it back to espresso. A large knob with ""steps"" or programmable buttons would be ideal.


- Must be quietish. We had a Capresso Infiniti before and it's noise level was fine. I'm not expecting ""quiet"", just something that won't drown out my wife's voice if she's on a conference call in an adjacent room with the door closed.


- Optimized for espresso, but produces decent drip. Nobody is going to be ruminating over the drip, but grind quality should be similar to a low-end burr grinder.


- Ideally fits under a kitchen cabinet, say &lt; 16""/40cm.


- Ideally under $500. Price is only an obstacle in that the purchase has to be justified to my wife, who thought $250 was crazy for a grinder. Something home repairable will be an easier sell if it's a more expensive model.

Previously I was buying bags of lavazza beans and they'd take a while to get through, loosing flavor. I've just understood the importance of fresh beans, not just freshly ground.

Currently on #24, China, and it's fruity; reminds me of a cocktail or maybe a fruity IPA. I've never enjoyed coffee more than this. Not sure if these are the best beans I can get, but I'd highly recommend the #20.

I really like to travel and buy beans or just take a quick stroll around my city and pick up couple new bags from local roasters. From time to time when I ask for a fresh roasts I’m getting into that discussion “you know, this one is at peak in about 3rd week” which from my experience is just bs :) Beside I like my coffee in around 10days from roast I also love to take it as a journey and brew when it’s 3-5 days and observe how it’s profile changes. 

I also respect that people behind the counter are either trained baristas or owners/roasters so no doubt that they know what they are talking about, my only “but” is that my experience (drinking :)) is different and most of the time when they try to sell me some bag it’s in its peak (such a coincidence!).

Don’t get me wrong, I vote with my wallet and my preference is most important to me in this case but was just wondering what do you think about it? What’s your take ? Do you also feel like someone is trying to sell you old beans of the shelf ? Do you have different perspective as a professional roaster ?

Edit:
I really appreciate all of your response guys/gals! So many other perspectives and informations - thank you!",1614433837
